Rap God,Eminem,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay!—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a hell yeah from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on I'm Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream.
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop,—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still Chunky but Funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.6K"
SICKO MODE,Travis Scott,"Astro, yeah

​m.A.A.d city,Kendrick Lamar,"If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, Ayy, y'all—duck!
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?

It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. Compton's Human Sacrifice
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?

Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe,Kendrick Lamar,"I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me

Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it Malibooyah

Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake
She on a diet, but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash

The Ringer,Eminem,"*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe Stan just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
Dawg, that's a date — Looks like an olive to me
Look, there's an apple! — No, it's not, it's a peach!
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, Only when it comes to ink and lyricists
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners72"
A Million Dreams,Ziv Zaifman,"I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see it

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
For the world we're gonna make8"
Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, Yeah, I'm good at little league.
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And God loves all his children is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
Man, that's gay gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no

'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
Err-eh-err-eh, onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on (Tailor-made)
I'm winnin', so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name
What?
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you
Fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)83"
Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst,Kendrick Lamar,"When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering Get 'em!
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that Sorry for your loss shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like It need to be told
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh


(On the phone)
Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?
Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!
Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.
We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.
Bring a nigga back a black!
Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.
Bring a nigga back a black!
(*Hangs up*)
Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?
Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say fuck the world, my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
Lord God, I come to You a sinner.
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
And I humbly repent for my sins.
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
I believe that Jesus is Lord.
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
I believe you raised Him from the dead.
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
I would ask that Jesus come into my life.
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
And be my Lord and Savior.
(And be my Lord and Savior)
I receive Jesus to take control of my life.
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
And that I may live for Him from this day forward.
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood.
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
In Jesus' name, amen.
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life20"
Lose You To Love Me,Selena Gomez,"You promised the world and I fell for it

Oldie,Odd Future,"Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you

The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, Catch up, nigga, it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, Get 'em, Mike G, then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

Fuck tha Police,N.W.A,"Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A. 
Yo, Dre, I got something to say
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police (Example of scene one)

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, Fuck you, punk!
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—
Fuck the police

*Knocking*
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police (The verdict)

The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here! (I want justice!)
Get him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police18"

Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)

Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it

Smash into everyone, crash into everything

Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (Get it)
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot21"

X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling

Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, Doo, doo, I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, Mmm, mmm!
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that suck my cock shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist37"
Mona Lisa,Lil Wayne,"I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, Get him, she say, I got you, I say, No, bitch, I said get him
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, What's wrong? He say, Nothin', keep restin', she say, What's missin'? How you know somethin' missin'?
He scratch his head, she say, Get back in bed, and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, Ooh
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, Don't be so obvious!
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place, and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, Good girl, just remember what I told you, she gave me the salute, I say, Girl, you're a soldier
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself
She say, Ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, Ooh, no emotion (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah19"
All Girls Are the Same,Juice WRLD,"Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh

All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love22"
FEAR.,Kendrick Lamar,"Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth

What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom16"
Mortal Man,Kendrick Lamar,"Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh
Yeah, uh

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(One two, one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”
Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?
Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
Right
You know what I’m saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
And I wanna lay it all down
In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
That’s crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?!

The Art of Peer Pressure,Kendrick Lamar,"Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now

One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still nigga, what is you sayin'?
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: Hello? What you doin'? — Kickin' it.
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, This what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan

We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's Dior Homme, not Dior, homie
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller

IFHY,Tyler, The Creator,"I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect

The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect

These Walls,Kendrick Lamar,"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room27"
The Other Side,Hugh Jackman & Zac Efron,"Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play?
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well, I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you
Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play?
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

Well, it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime?
Fifteen
I'd do eight
Twelve
Maybe nine
Ten
Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play?
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do (To the other side)
So if you do like me (Going to the other side)
'Cause if we do, we're going to the other side
We're going to the other side5"
Glow Like Dat,Rich Brian,"I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)

You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers (yuh)

I be on my Mac DeMarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves cloves cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (Ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (Ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (Ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (Yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (Skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (Skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

All these parties I attend, but never know the celebration
I let you do what you want, no need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go, but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings, but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin' 'bout the things that you pursue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (Ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (Ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (Ayy)

The Real Her,Drake,"People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, That ain't true
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
Someone Like You, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies8"
ME!,Taylor Swift,"I promise that you'll never find another like me

By myself, gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo

No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo

Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw, though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you

Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it

Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again

I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Tastes like Juicy Fruit

Flawed crystals hang from your ears

Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool

Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?

Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you

New God Flow, fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholesaler
I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yuugh)
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' HAM in Ibiza done took a toll on us

'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw, man, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was frontin'
Aw, man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 3-1-2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
Forty killings in a weekend, forty killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?

I'm on fire, ayy, that's what Richard Pryor say

Still got it all in the bag, B (Yeah)

Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven't ate since twelve and it's after seven
We feed the nigga like forty chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I— I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' they wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic (Come on)
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Said and shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said, Probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I'm not bow-legged, but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof and saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees

​invisible string,Taylor Swift,"Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some

To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
A to the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang-bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang-bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, a but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money a than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again
Everybody go, Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

A Master Gee, a my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, a right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
A come alive, y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just a wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock-rock, y'all, a get on the floor
I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind
I said a 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, a get on the floor
A come alive, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

Said a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-a-hop and you don't stop rockin'
To the bang-bang, the boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

A-skiddlee bebop, we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America, we love you
A 'cause ya rock and a roll with a so much soul
You could rock 'til you're hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we're like hot butter on a breakfast toast
We rock it up, a baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie, the bang-bang, the boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

A hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop
A rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat

I say I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
A just blow your mind so a that you can't speak
A do a thing, but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, a sing that song
A to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang-bang, the bong

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, a with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said, By the way, baby, what's your name?
Said I go by the name Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said, He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said, You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
A just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, a don't stop, y'all, a tick a tock, y'all, you don't stop

It go, Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today? (Say what?)
'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

It was twelve o'clock a one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling alright
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now, the group ya hear is called Phase 2
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a cutting the jams and making it freak
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down and make ya rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something, there's still one fact
That to have a party, got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping, you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase 2 a just a doing the do
Rocking ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
A come alive, girls, a get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on until the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
A come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

I say, a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat, beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
A so you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull
A so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, Man, there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
But while the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh, so you say that's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
Oh, so you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend a two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubba, but we're still friends

A with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

I said, A Hank, a can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
A can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, A come on, make, m-make the people move

I go toot the horns and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme
So from '66 to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you've heard
I didn't even bite, not a god**** word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat-beat y'all
A lets rock, y'all, ya don't stop

It go, Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends

A like that, y'all, a to the beat, y'all
A beat-beat, y'all, ya don't stop
A Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
A like the Bar-Kays singing Holy Ghost
The sounds I throw down, a they're played the most
Just a like my man, a Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
A get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
A to the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, a get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Bar-Kays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doing the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
'Cause with the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven
Don't ya know I went off?
I gotta run on down to the beat, you see
Getting right on down, making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was a really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine I was a right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
We're going on and on, and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on, and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A going on and on, and don't ya dare stop
A rock-rock, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
They call me the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

I'm gonna move ya here, I'm gonna move ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shocks your mind
I'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind
Said, just rock it to the east and move it to the west
Move it toward the lady you love-love the best
Master Gee, get it on
Taggin' all the girls, goin' down
(Gimme time, I'ma shock your mind)
(A come and jig-jig-jigglin' your behind)10"
Dance with the Devil,Immortal Technique,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was makin' a million
Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of 13
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities on other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Startin' fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock
Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well-guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted
So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life
Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone
Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head
And knocked her onto the floor
This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screamin', Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lyin'
Bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow
He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted
You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever

Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?
Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' back
Into the grace of God and comin' after you
Y’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit
Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit
I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!

Go ‘head and grip Glocks
I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I’ll watch you topple flat
Put away your rings and holla back
Can’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps
Beneath the surface
I’m overheatin' your receiving circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick
In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin' a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you’re less than nothin'
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction

You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me
I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I’m on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I’m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece
I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece
I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology
So you’re nothin', like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven
You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked16"

I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys7"
Diplomatic Immunity,Drake,"Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, What scent that is, boy?
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house the embassy
The studio the chapel, I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me don't worry, I got your money like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, Where does the day go?
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I9"
I Have Nothing,Whitney Houston,"Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me, no
Don't walk away from me

Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you6"
Gotta Go My Own Way,High School Musical Cast,"Troy...
Listen
(sung)
I gotta say what's on my mind
Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try, somehow, the plan
Is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
(My own way)
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up and I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leavin' today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

What about us?
What about everythin' we've been through?

What about trust?

You know I never wanted to hurt you

What about me?

What am I supposed to do?
I gotta leave but I'll miss you

Oh
So, I've got to move on and be who I am

Why do you have to go?

I just don't belong here, I hope you understand

I'm trying to understand

We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now

I want you to stay

I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am
What about us?

I just don't belong here, I hope you understand

I'm trying to understand

We might find our place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way1"
Chained to the Rhythm,Katy Perry,"Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm

Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song

We're all chained to the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat

I’m Not Racist,Joyner Lucas,"With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', Black Lives Matter
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', Nigga, this, and, Nigga, that
Call everybody, Nigga, and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, Nigga, then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, All Lives Matter, is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, Nigga, is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist16"

Don’t Cry,Lil Wayne,"Yeah
C5

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: Don’t cry, stay tuned.
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, It's just you and I
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise13"

​illicit affairs,Taylor Swift,"Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times7"

Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch!)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)
I hate this, screaming, Fuck patience!
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest, fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler, The Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah (Wolf Gang)
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin

Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)

I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out fuck faggots
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

The Great Gatsby (Chapter I),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;
If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,
Till she cry “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have you!”
- Thomas Parke D'Invilliers.
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.
I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog — at least I had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.
There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News.”— and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.
It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.
Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight into Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.
And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens — finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body — he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage — a cruel body.
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked — and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.
“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.
The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. There was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.
The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it — indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.
The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise — she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression — then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.
“I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see.That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)
At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again — the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.
I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.
I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.
“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.
“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”
“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. To-morrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”
“I’d like to.”
“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”
“Never.”
“Well, you ought to see her. She’s ——”
Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.
“What you doing, Nick?”
“I’m a bond man.”
“Who with?”
I told him.
“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.
This annoyed me.
“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”
“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”
At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started — it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.
“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”
“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.”
“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “I’m absolutely in training.”
Her host looked at her incredulously.
“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”
I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.
“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.”
“I don’t know a single ——”
“You must know Gatsby.”
“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”
Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.
Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.
“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”
“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.
“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”
Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.
“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”
We all looked — the knuckle was black and blue.
“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a ——”
“I hate that word hulking,” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”
“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.
“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”
I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.
“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read ‘The Rise of the Colored Empires’ by this man Goddard?”
“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be — will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”
“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we ——”
“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”
“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
“You ought to live in California —” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.
“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and ——” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “— And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization — oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”
There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”
“That’s why I came over to-night.”
“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose ——”
“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.
“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened — then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.
“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a — of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”
This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.
Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.
“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor ——” I said.
“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”
“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.
“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”
“I don’t.”
“Why ——” she said hesitantly, “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”
“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.
Miss Baker nodded.
“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”
Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.
“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.
She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.
He’s singing away ——” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”
“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”
The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing — my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.
The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.
Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.
“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”
“I wasn’t back from the war.”
“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”
Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.
“I suppose she talks, and — eats, and everything.”
“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”
“Very much.”
“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about — things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘all right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool — that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”
“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so — the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated — God, I’m sophisticated!”
The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.
Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.
Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post. — the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.
When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.
“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”
Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.
“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”
“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament to-morrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.”
“Oh — you’re Jordan Baker.”
I knew now why her face was familiar — its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.
“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”
“If you’ll get up.”
“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”
“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of — oh — fling you together. You know — lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing ——”
“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”
“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”
“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.
“Her family.”
“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”
Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.
“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.
“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white ——”
“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.
“Did I?” She looked at me.
“I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know ——”
“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.
I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”
“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.”
“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”
“It’s libel. I’m too poor.”
“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”
Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumors, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage.
Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich — nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms — but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York.” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.
Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone — fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.
I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone — he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward — and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.14"

Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your *beep* is weak buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind

I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you crawl
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches

Come Alive,Hugh Jackman, Keala Settle, Daniel Everidge, Zendaya & The Greatest Showman Ensemble,"You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake

'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!

I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

No more living in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes

'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

We will be the light that's turning
Bottle up but keep on shining
You can prove there's more to you

You cannot be afraid

Go and light your light

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more

So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like Who that spittin'? I'm like It's me. He's like Oh, well okay.
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap
No ID: Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off Xxplosive and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on This Can't Be Life.
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, Oh you a real soulful dude.
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

Tell me what you think of this. And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, What you think of it?

And I was like, Man that shit tight, you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, Heart of the City. And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did Nothing Like It already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, Yo play that one beat for him. And I played Heart of the City. And really I made Heart of the City, I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, Yo what's up I'm Kanye.

You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like oh shit. And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, yo Jay I could rap. And I spit this rap that said, uh I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips. And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, Man that was tight.

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z. You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, yo but I rap too. Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them Jesus Walks and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, Naw. Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

Dame was like, Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like oh shit

I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick

You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on. I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, oh, word? Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, oh he's just a producer-rapper, and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, yo... Capitol pulled on the deal

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?13"

Sanguine Paradise,Lil Uzi Vert,"We be throwin' money in a spiral

She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick

Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now

Hate It or Love It,The Game,"Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, Check, check out my melody
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,"Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear11"
What a Wonderful World,Louis Armstrong,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, How do you do?
They're really saying, I love you

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world

My man Inf left a TEC and a nine at my crib
Turned him self in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', It's so hard
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?
When he's stickin' you and takin' all of your money

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)

Big up! Big up! It's a stick up! Stick up!
And I'm shootin' niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sendin' mom duke a wreath
You're talkin' to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over bein' resistant
'Cause when I lick shots them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
Three fifty-seven slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, (Yeah, nigga, peel!)
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckers don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm diggin' in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggas come through, I'm takin' high school rings too
Bitches get ********* for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed, too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it

And if he start to scream, bom-bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit, the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
I guess to get his life tooken

You see him by himself, What's up Tony? Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!

Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, Don't wait up
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway

When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway

Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor

Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plottin' an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent up on a little
Like Osama with a bomb under the bin and down the middle
Of the Pentagon and hit a kindergartner with a rental (Stop!)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore? (Huh?)
Why you always gotta smack a whore? (Huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (Huh?)
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, “'Walk on Water' sucks”
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit
'Fore you heard it, so you formed your verdict
While you sat wit' your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (Chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (Wait, Em!)
But nowadays every flow, every cadence sound the same (Skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why
I write 'til the page is outta space (Duh!)
From 7 Mile in Novara
To How can I be down?, all of us tryna pile in the car (Yeah!)
We shot for the stars (Yeah!)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (Yeah!)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (Yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (Woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
Well, I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyoncé this and Kehlani that (Yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
To the body bag, I'll be back

Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job

Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, The Rapper
Magical word (Poof), please say Kadabra
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb

Patiently Waiting,50 Cent,"Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers

It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, We don't love them hoes
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker

​tolerate it,Taylor Swift,"I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I sit and watch you6"
Sexxx Dreams,Lady Gaga,"(Last night) Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinkin' about you) Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty) All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here (It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white (By the one before)
Glove the bed (He was kind of nasty)
Help me here (And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night

Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

You could turn to stone or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and... oh my God!

Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)

But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer, let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

Hey (No, no)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle (No, no, yeah)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
(We know, we know, we know)
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing, yeah
But nothing can compare to when you're naked (Hey!)
(Perfect when you naked, together with you)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah5"
Veleno 7,Gemitaiz & MadMan,"PK
Mixer T, cì

È il Gemitaiz, te rispondo ancora: Che voi? (Uh)
Cambio l'attacco che siamo arrivati alla settima
Con M siamo come quella bibita energetica
C'avessi i capelli, c'avrei una tipa che mi pettina
Se giro questa, lei che mi molesta
Frate', poi piscio in testa a chi ci contesta
Queste tipe perfette sono la ricompensa
La bocca si muove da sola e va tipo Tesla
Sì, davvero, è Veleno 7
Faccio ancora merda che ti sorprende
Mi dispiace, giuro, per chi non comprende
Sono cold temper, ma lascio queste tipe contente
Poi mi schianto al suolo, John Denver
Sto in alto dove il cell non prende
Tu stai in basso, il tuo studio sembra un call center
È inutile che piangi, il tuo disco non vende
Neanche se ci alleghi un bel viaggio in Medio Oriente
Se faccio il rap, è fatto bene, frate', cazzo me ne
Di questo che parla dei miei concerti e poi manco viene
Sono un bracconiere, se voglio, rappo un mese, fra', e le rappo tese
La tua tipa si piega in avanti e non è giapponese (Uh)
Giù con M, baby, sputo gemme, non vi rubo niente
Vinco sempre, ho tutte le risposte come il Google Center
Siamo due leggende, fumo come Snoop, bevo come Bender
Torno in auto blu oppure con le bende
Sì, qualcuno qua c'ha precedenti
Certo che non li leggo, frate', quei commenti (Ah)
Siamo egocentrici, almeno sentici
Se no, prenditi male e poi genuflettiti ai due flow epici
Sale quando non te lo aspetti
Tipo dei medicinali o degli anestetici
Tu puoi centellinare, ma mi sa che smetti
Tipo come se entri in mare e nelle tasche hai i pesi, suonate pessimi (Faggots)
Alle feste apro le teste
Essere o non essere, ho una bomba che è un Winchester (Eh)
Cento colpi e ti investe (Uh), non ci fare richieste
Guardaci diventare bestie dopo una cena di pesce (Ah)
Uh, mamma mia, quasi duecento in galleria
Di paranoia ho già la mia, danza come una ballerina
Fresco come la Valtellina
Corro più veloce, prendo la bandierina
(Ehi, M)
Le tecniche che cerchi, fai scouting
Fumo e faccio i cerchi dell'Audi (Ahah)
Drowning, Cali smoking con Davi
In polo navy da quando 'sti cazzo di album li coloravi
Mezza Italia rappa, trappa, ma non sono bravi
Li lasciamo nella merda con i loro pari
Non provare a ricopiarmi che fai solo danni (Ehi)
Morirò e farò i contanti con i miei ologrammi
(Oh no, ci risiamo) Ehi
Versi top, zì, ce ne ho troppi (Uh)
Belli ghiotti, Pernigotti (Uh)
Nel cappello e nei cappotti, Mary Poppins (Uh)
Sul carello coi biscotti, con i pizzoccheri (Uh)
Vedi un picco degli ascolti, divento serio (Seh, seh)
Prenoto un volo in due secondi, duemila euro (Seh, seh)
Fai la fattura e poi ti scordi, controlla i soldi
Pensa al dinero, ti ricordi come vivevo? (Vai, vai, vai)
Spacco giusto un pochino, poi scappo giù col bottino
Dal cazzo di condominio, ti mangio, ti cuocio vivo
Non stacco, c'ho il flow continuo, compatto lo sai che scrivo
Cattivo vampiro con il canino lo affilo
Vedi un puntino, sei a tiro, ti uccido perché ti miro
Non troppo in alto né in basso, tipo all'altezza del busto
Mi fotte un cazzo, sono pazzo, Frank Castle, Billy Russo
Quindi molto meglio se mi miri giusto
Occhio a come ti comporti, siamo forti
Suono il flow tipo gli accordi, pianoforti
Di goal ne facciamo troppi, tipo Totti
Igor Protti, morti, rigor mortis
Sempre sia lodato M per 'sti rappers
Sempre sia lodato il verde che ci serve (Uh)
Con Gem lo sai che siamo frecce
Da quando volevamo solo emergere
Ad ora che dettiamo legge (Fra')
Sto con una tipa da tachicardia (Ah)
Pensa ogni mattina che fatica questa vita mia (Ah)
Non lo so la svolta quanto dura, la mia è una mania
Spacco solo troppo, non c'è cura a questa malattia (Ah)
M può fottersene (Seh)
Il mio flow te le promette, frate', è Viggo Mortensen
Kevin Costner con un canne mozze
Prova a fottermi, mi inviti a nozze (M)

BTS (방탄소년단) - Blue & Grey (English Translation),Genius English Translations,"Where is my angel?
The end of a tiring day
Someone come and save me, please
Is overshadowed by a sigh
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The tears reflected in the mirror mean
My colors hid in the smile, blue and grey

I really don’t know what went wrong
I grew up with a blue question mark in my mind
Maybe that’s why I’ve been fighting for my life
But looking behind, I’m standing hеre dazed
The powеrful shadow swallows me
The question mark is still blue
Is it anxiety or depression?
Am I just an animal that regrets
Or is it me born out of loneliness?
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't get eaten away, I'll find the exit

I just wanna be happier
Melt me, I'm cold
I've reached out my hand countless times
The echo is colorless
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself 
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
I still feel my heart
Breathe faster like when
I walked on the cold winter streets
Don't say you're fine
'Cause you're not
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much

The road I always walk and the light I always receive
But today seems like an unfamiliar scene
Have I become used to it or have I collapsed?
This piece of metal does feel heavy
A grey rhino approaches
I just stand there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like 'color' embarrass me
The wide grey zone is comfortable
With hundreds of millions of grey faces
When it rains, I dance
Over this city, my world
Raise a toast to
The fog on clear days
And all the dust always
Here with me on rainy days
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth in my hands
They're cold, that's why I need more of you
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
If I laugh in the future far away
I'll tell you that I did

After secretly taking back words floating in the air
I now fall asleep at dawn, good night6"
Maybe The Night,Ben&Ben,"I want to lay down by the fire with you
Where souls are glowing, ever warmer too
Your love surrounds me like a lullaby
Singing softly, you are mine, oh mine

Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old

Maybe the night
Holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might
Want to settle down, just be near
Stay together here

We follow the pull of fate, into this moment
We follow the pull of fate, into this moment

Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together

Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together
Stay together
Here"

It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)

Uh, Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (Two-step)

I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, A woman is woman, love the creation
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain’t a thing
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth10"

Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports

This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming

Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana


Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pock'ing on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox, there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said see you later

Asshole,Eminem,"Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinkin': If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
‘Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said, There ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out!
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows12"

Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón
Me palpita lento el corazón
Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras (Uh)
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Smile,JAY-Z,"Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer
Smile
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's You Bring Me Joy slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, Fuck you, pay me
Now it's, Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Never Let Me Down,Kanye West,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up

I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us us free like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self-down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive8"

Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets

I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters

Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah, we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capiche? Homie, what up?
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mama's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

Mmmn, I'm thinking...

​coffee,Miguel,"I wish I could paint our love
These moments in vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism
Peach colored skies we feel the sunrise
Two lost angels discover salvation
Don't you wish we could run away now?
Yes, let's
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

I wish I could paint our love

And gun play turns into pillow talk (You'll know for sure)
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams (That I'm all yours)
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning (All yours darling)

Coffee in the morning (Woman, do you know what you've done to me baby?)
I don't wanna wake you (Stay darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep (Stay darling, yeah)
It's the smell of your hair (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel (Never know how it feels)
I've never felt comfortable (Feel like this, woman)

Turns into coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end)
Coffee in the morning (You'll never be the end of me)

And it's the way that we feel (Never felt like this, woman)
I've never felt comfortable like this (Feel like this, darling, no)

Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight

Candy Store,Heathers the Musical Ensemble,"Are we gonna have a problem?
You got a bone to pick?
You’ve come so far
Why now are you pulling on my dick?
I’d normally slap your face off
And everyone here could watch
But I’m feeling nice
Here’s some advice
Listen up, biotch!
I like!

Lookin’ hot
Buying stuff they cannot

I like!

Drinkin’ hard
Maxin’ Dad’s credit card

I like!
Skippin’ gym
Scaring her
Screwing him

I like!

Killer clothes

Kickin’ nerds in the nose!

If you lack the balls
You can go play dolls
Let your mommy fix you a snack

Woah!

Or you could come smoke
Pound some rum and coke
In my Porsche with the quarterback
Woah! Woah! Woah!
Honey, whatchu waitin’ for?
Welcome to my candy store
Time for you to prove
You’re not a loser anymore
Then step into my candy store

Guys fall

At your feet
Pay the check
Help you cheat

All you

Have to do

Say goodbye to Shamu
That freak’s

Not your friend
I can tell in the end

If she

Had your shot

She would leave you to rot!
‘Course if you don’t care
Fine! Go braid her hair
Maybe Sesame Street is on

Woah!

Or forget that creep
And get in my Jeep

Let’s go tear up someone’s lawn

Woah! Woah! Woah!
Honey, whatchu waitin’ for?
Welcome to my candy store
You just gotta prove
You’re not a pussy anymore
Then step into my candy store
You can join the team

Or you can bitch and moan

You can live the dream

Or you can die alone

You can fly with eagles

Or if you prefer

Keep on testing me

And end up like her!

Veronica, look! Ram invited me to his homecoming party! This proves he’s been thinking about me!

Color me stoked!

I’m so happy!

Woah!

Honey, whatchu waiting fo—

Fade Into You,Mazzy Star,"I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of light into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
A million smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew6"
The City,The Game,"See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city

Tell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' résumé
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smokin' that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin' weight
Now a nigga's sellin' millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performin' in front of millions, nigga, every race
6-4 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate!
But I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
I'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about the West died
Can't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside
You test me, you test God, I'm His son
It say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov… probably Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mill' that I slaughter
And serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When I'm the nigga sold 5 mill' out the gate and numbers do not lie
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
I gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin' for
I'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you, like, What's goin' on, baby boy?
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
Compton! – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!

Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!5"
Hey Mama,Kanye West,"(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

Forrest Gump mama said, Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true

Holy Key,DJ Khaled,"(This is, this is...)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said Fuck Mother Earth, that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My eyes went dark
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't know where
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Time is
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Slowly
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place7"
Welcome to the Internet,Bo Burnham,"Welcome to the internet! Have a look around
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found
We've got mountains of content—some better, some worse
If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first

Welcome to the internet! Come and take a seat
Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?
There's no need to panic; this isn't a test, haha
Just nod or shake your head, and we'll do the rest

Welcome to thе internet! What would you prefеr?
Would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?
Be happy! Be horny! Be bursting with rage!
We've got a million different ways to engage

Welcome to the internet! Put your cares aside
Here's a tip for straining pasta; here's a nine-year-old who died
We've got movies and doctors and fantasy sports
And a bunch of colored-pencil drawings of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other

Welcome to the internet! Hold on to your socks
'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock
They are grainy and off-putting; he just sent you more
Don't act surprised—you know you like it, you whore
See a man beheaded, get offended, see a shrink
Show us pictures of your children, tell us every thought you think
Start a rumor, buy a broomer, send a death threat to a boomer
Or DM a girl and groom her; do a zoomer find a tumor in your—
Here's a healthy breakfast option, you should kill your mom
Here's why women never fuck you; here's how you can build a bomb
Which Power Ranger are you? Take this quirky quiz
Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids

Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything all of the time
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything all of the time

You know, it wasn't always like this

Not very long ago, just before your time
Right before the towers fell, circa '99
This was catalogs, travel blogs, a chatroom or two
We set our sights and spent our nights waiting for you!
You, insatiable you
Mommy let you use her iPad; you were barely two
And it did all the things we designed it to do
Now, look at you! Oh, look at you!
You, you! Unstoppable, watchable
Your time is now, your inside's out, honey, how you grew
And if we stick together, who knows what we'll do?
It was always the plan to put the world in your hand
(*Laughs*)

Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A bit of everything all of the time
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
Anything and everything all of the time
Could I interest you in everything all of the time?
A little bit of everything all of the time

Yeah, ayy, look

She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons

Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me No once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

Crazy Story,King Von,"And I'ma let that MAC fly just like my nigga Durk (Bow)
I’ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I'ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on (Von), alright (Von)

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shit, she told me where he be
I said for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like, Von, you already know, just put your girl on fleek
I’m like, Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want, some shoes?
Jimmy Choo? With a handbag, too? Red or baby blue?
She get to smilin', she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughin', coulda been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speedin', coulda been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, coulda been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script ’cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it’s like six, told her hit his phone, meet her in The Wic
But he ain't go, but he ain’t that slow, say meet 'em at the store
I'm like cool, let 'em front his move, do what he gon’ do
'Cause this the plot, put 'em in the pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot, but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot​, but that just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6-24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pullin' up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fourth
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
Block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happen, I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lacking, 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out, What's crackin'?
I'm like, What? I'm like, Nigga who? I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang when it comes​ to chains
So I rise, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh, this no lie
Bitch it's do or die, you said you gon' slide
You got some nerve, your shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd
Bitch we not from 63rd

Aston Martin Music,Rick Ross,"Oh
Let's pull the 2-seater out baby
It's where ever you wanna go!
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take, wee
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the, Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that

Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
They gettin' off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper

Firework,Katy Perry,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon8"

Where This Flower Blooms,Tyler, The Creator,"Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford

Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float

Flower boy T, nigga, that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk

Ah, shit!

Ahh, ahh

Paper Rings,Taylor Swift,"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

Pure Souls,Kanye West,"Life change when you famous

And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)

I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, They don't understand me
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)

Well, here goes, but here goes

That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was Bang, Bang
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five

This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, Free the old man
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'

God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my mama made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins

Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lies
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like shhh
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day, but I spent my night-time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear-back or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a lifeline
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali'll swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament?
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures and gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery Babylon tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground4"
No. 1 Party Anthem,Arctic Monkeys,"So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could

Tú No Metes Cabra (Remix),Bad Bunny,"Cuando ustedes me ven, yo sé que tiemblan
El que tenga miedo a morir, que no nazca
Dinero, puta', chipete' y AK
Bebecita, al que te toque vo'a quemarle las pata'
Tengo una 40 to'a negra como Baby Rasta
Un fuletazo y lo voy a dejar haciendo gimnasta
Te dejamo' la cara como pasta
Tengo presidentes muerto' pa' comprarte a tu gata
Mulata, fuma conmigo y se arrebata
Un fantasmeo en el expreso y te rompemos la lata

8 Mile,Eminem,"It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'

You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)10"

Suddenly,A$AP Rocky,"I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, None shall pass
None shall pass, none shall pass
Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, None shall pass
None shall pass, none shall pass
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, Enough's enough!
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, None shall pass
None shall pass, none shall pass8"

Alfred’s Theme,Eminem,"Before I check the mic (Check, check, one, two)
I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (Good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (Yeah) give zero fucks, then I (Yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (Uh), cup my nuts, then I (Yeah)
Check my ball hair (What?), make sure it's all there (Yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (Yeah)
It's Music to Bе Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I (Only one eye) got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like *snores*
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands
Shit, hold on, man
Motherfuck
Happy birthday to—
Fuck (Shh, quiet)

I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

What the fuck? Hold on, wait
I'm Diddy's side bitch?
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)
From the MMLP to (Huh?) MTBMB (Bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)
So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)
Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)
My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, Chirp, chirp
I said, Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy her designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)
And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)
Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole
Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
Fuck it9"
Get Free,Lana Del Rey,"Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For… and for… (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life

Paris Morton Music,Drake,"Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh

Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back3"
The Great Gatsby (Chapter III),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"There was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York — every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.
Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited — they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it — signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to some one before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.
“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.
“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to——” She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.
“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”
“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.
“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.
“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”
It was for Lucille, too.
“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”
“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.
“Sure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”
“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with ANYbody.”
“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.
“Gatsby. Somebody told me——”
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.
“I don’t think it’s so much THAT,” argued Lucille sceptically; “it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.
“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country-side—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour. “This is much too polite for me.”
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas
A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot
“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously
“About what?” He waved his hand toward the book-shelves
“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”
“The books?”
He nodded
“Absolutely real — have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and — Here! Lemme show you.”
Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the “Stoddard Lectures.”
“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too — didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse
“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering
“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”
“Has it?”
“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re ——”
“You told us.” We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts.” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.
“Your face is familiar,” he said, politely. “Weren’t you in the Third Division during the war?”
“Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion.”
“I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”
We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.
“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”
“What time?”
“Any time that suits you best.”
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.
“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there——” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.” For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.
“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”
“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”
He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.
“Who is he?” I demanded.
“Do you know?”
“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”
“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”
“Now YOU’RE started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.” A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.
“However, I don’t believe it.”
“Why not?” “I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.
“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as Vladimir Tostoff’s JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD.”
The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.
“I beg your pardon.”
Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.
“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”
“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.
“Yes, madame.”
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”
“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”
“We’re always the first ones to leave.”
“So are we.”
“Well, we’re almost the last to-night,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”
In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say good-bye.
Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long were we in there?”
“Why, about an hour.” “It was—simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully in my face: “Please come and see me. . . . Phone book . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard . . . My aunt . . .” She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.
“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane to-morrow morning, at nine o’clock.”
Then the butler, behind his shoulder: “Philadelphia wants you on the ‘phone, sir.”
“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there. . . . good night.”
“Good night.”
“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. “Good night, old sport. . . . good night.”
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupe which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.
“How’d it happen?”
He shrugged his shoulders.
“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.
“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?” “Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”
“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”
“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
“Do you want to commit suicide?”
“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!”
“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.
“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”
“Look!”
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
“It came off,” some one explained.
He nodded.
“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:
“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”
At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.
“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”
“But the WHEEL’S off!”
He hesitated.
“No harm in trying,” he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.
Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.
I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.
I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.
Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.
It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.
“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”
“I am careful.”
“No, you’re not.”
“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.
“What’s that got to do with it?”
“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”
“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”
“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”
Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.3"

Dai primi ponti saltati per aria
Tutti lavori saltati, mio frate' ha
Feat con i conti saldati per strada
Presa bene che non c'hanno catturato
Genovese come nel cantautorato
Poi fermo restando tutti cazzi miei
Paradiso ciò che meritano i miei
Faccio così e così
Che vuoi saperne di chi, di chi
Te vuoi sgrammare soltanto un feat
Sentirti dire di sì di sì
Vinciamo perché non ci siamo divisi
Sto ancora con Mario nel nuovo di IZI
Curato dal diablo
È il giorno del karma
E, fra', noi gli facciamo un regalo
Io lo so cosa è meglio per me
Solo che poi non lo faccio
Non ho soldi, sì, ma per adesso
Vedrai, prima o poi li faccio
Compravo i libri al Libraccio
Voglio soltanto un riscatto
Per me e la mia banda
Fumiamo in spiaggia
Versa la fanta col ghiaccio

E grida
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, oh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana
Grida Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, oh
Wild Bandana, Wild Bandana, eh
Wild Bandana, grida Wild Bandana

Portavo i fogli a Duate su al campetto
Sì, in cerca di rispetto
Ne avevo circa sedici, un nanetto più o meno
Aspetto il treno a Cogoleto sopra il terzo
Che ancora scruti per il controllore Sei senza biglietto
Conosco Vaz Tè in giro per le piazze
Dal centro alla periferia sto in sintonia con mille razze
Schifavo le ragazze perché mi sentivo brutto
Ho cominciato con le canne perché mi serviva un tuffo
Il primo tape col Sangue e le radici sporche
Macchie, cicatrici, in panne con gli amici
Rubavo le bici per tornare a casa
A casa con mia madre e mia sorella litigava
A cena ero isolato, a scuola ci provavo
E lo studio era il mio tempo
Sempre dentro con le tempie calde
Lavoravo in stalla per stare contento
Ed ingoiavo balle come fieno per stare sereno, come il tempo
Che col passare mi sentivo più empio
E provo a lasciare, ma poi cado sempre
Strisciate come serpi, io non vi devo niente
Che ho conosciuto Rave quando già vedeva male
Quando due canne al parchetto separavano le strade
Le Chester nel pacchetto e dieci grammi in palla
Quella faccia gialla che Mi raccomando, mangia
Raccomando mamma, raccomando con i miei
Non ho mica quarant'anni come i DSA
La merda che si mangiano nei pasti, fra'
Io non ho laurea, ma sono un dottore
Giro canne, giro il mondo come l'Equatore
Faccio questo e faccio quello perché non ho limiti
I giudizi li metto da parte
Sono i brividi che sento che mi lanciano avanti
Ho fatto guerra per un sacco, mosse al sacco con i guanti
Ho fatto guerra per un cazzo, adesso siamo a patto d'armi
Che non so se stare o se devo scappare
O se forse devo pagare dazi
Io lo so cosa è meglio per me
Solo che poi non lo faccio
Non ho soldi, sì, ma per adesso
Vedrai, prima o poi li faccio
Compravo i libri al Libraccio
Voglio soltanto un riscatto

The Great Gatsby (Chapter VI),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.
“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.
“Why — any statement to give out.”
It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”
It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the “underground pipe-line to Canada” attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.
James Gatz — that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career — when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.
I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people — his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God — a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that — and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.
For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorbtion he took for granted.
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.
An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.
Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid sub-journalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little Girls Bay.
To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody — he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.
He was employed in a vague personal capacity — while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.
I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face — the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.
And it was from Cody that he inherited money — a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.
He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.
It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.
They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.
“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”
As though they cared!
“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”
He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . I’m sorry——
“Did you have a nice ride?”
“Very good roads around here.”
“I suppose the automobiles——”
“Yeah.”
Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.
“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”
“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”
“About two weeks ago.”
“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”
“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.
“That so?”
Tom turned to me.
“You live near here, Nick?”
“Next door.”
“That so?”
Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.
“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”
“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”
“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”
“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”
“You come to supper with ME,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”
This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.
“Come along,” he said—but to her only.
“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”
Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go, and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.
“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.
“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.
Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.
“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.
“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”
The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.
“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”
“She says she does want him.”
“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”
Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.
“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”
Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.
Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.
They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.
“These things excite me so,” she whispered.
“If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green——”
“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.
“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvelous——”
“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”
Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.
“We don’t go around very much,” he said. “In fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”
“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.
“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.
“The man bending over her is her director.”
He took them ceremoniously from group to group:
“Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan——” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”
“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”
But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby, for Tom remained “the polo player.” for the rest of the evening.
“I’ve never met so many celebrities!” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”
Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.
“Well, I liked him anyhow.”
“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”
Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”
Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”
“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” . . . she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.
We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.
“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”
The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.
“Wha’?”
A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:
“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”
“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.
“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’”
“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude. “But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”
“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”
“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.
“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”
It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched him stoop to one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.
I like her, said Daisy, I think she's lovely.
But the rest offended her-- and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented place that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand
I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved agains a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, that rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.
“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”
“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.
“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”
“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.
He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.
“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”
A breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar.
“At least they’re more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.
“You didn’t look so interested.”
“Well, I was.”
Tom laughed and turned to me.
“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”
Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.
“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”
“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”
“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores. He built them up himself.”
The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.
“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.
Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where THREE O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.
I stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.
“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.
“Of course she did.”
“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”
He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.
“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”
“You mean about the dance?”
“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”
He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: I never loved you. After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house-just as if it were five years ago.
And she doesn't understand, he said. She used to be able to understand. We'd sit for hours-
He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers.
I wouldn't ask too much of her, I ventured. You can't repeat the past.
Can't repeat the past? he cried incredulously. Why of course you can!
He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.
I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before, he said, nodding determinedly. She'll see.
He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was.
. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees-he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.
His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.
Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something-an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.2"

The Great Gatsby (Chapter VII),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.
“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”
“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir.” in a dilatory, grudging way.
“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”
“Who?” he demanded rudely.
“Carraway.”
“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.
My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.
Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.
“Going away?” I inquired.
“No, old sport.”
“I hear you fired all your servants.”
“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”
So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.
“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”
“I see.”
He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.
The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.
“Oh, my!” she gasped.
I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.
“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?”
My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!
. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.
“The master’s body!” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”
What he really said was: “Yes . . . yes . . . I’ll see.”
He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.
“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.
The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.
“We can’t move,” they said together.
Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.
“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.
Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.
Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.
“The rumor is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”
We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all. . . . I’m under no obligations to you at all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”
“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.
“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”
Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.
“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .”
“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.
As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.
“You know I love you,” she murmured.
“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.
Daisy looked around doubtfully.
“You kiss Nick too.”
“What a low, vulgar girl!”
“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.
“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”
The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.
“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”
Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small, reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.
“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.
“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small, white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”
“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”
“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”
“Where’s Daddy?”
“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”
Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.
“Come, Pammy.”
“Good-by, sweetheart!”
With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.
Gatsby took up his drink.
“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.
We drank in long, greedy swallows.
“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.
“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”
I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.
“I’m right across from you.”
“So you are.”
Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.
“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”
We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.
“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”
“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”
“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”
Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its senselessness into forms.
“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”
“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”
Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.
“You always look so cool,” she repeated.
She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.
“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man ——”
“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re all going to town.”
He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.
“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”
His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.
“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?”
“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”
“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.” He didn’t answer.
“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”
They went up-stairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.
“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.
“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”
“Oh.”
A pause.
“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads——”
“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.
“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom. He went inside.
Gatsby turned to me rigidly:
“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”
“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of——” I hesitated.
“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.
That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .
Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.
“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”
“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.
“Yes.”
“Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.”
The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.
“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.
“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.”
A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.
“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”
He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.
“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.”
She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.
“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.
“See what?”
He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.
“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science——”
He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss.
“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I could have gone deeper if I’d known——”
“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.
“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”
“About Gatsby.”
“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”
“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.
“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”
“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”
“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.”
“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.
“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!”
We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.
“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.
“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.” Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.
“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”
“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”
“What’s the matter?”
“I’m all run down.”
“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”
With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.
“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”
“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”
“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.
“Like to buy it?”
“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”
“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”
“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”
“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.
“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”
The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.
“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.
“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”
“What do I owe you?”
“Dollar twenty.”
The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.
“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over to-morrow afternoon.”
That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.
In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.
There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easy-going blue coupe.
“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when every one’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”
The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupe came to a stop, and Daisy signaled us to draw up alongside.
“Where are we going?” she cried.
“How about the movies?”
“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly, “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”
“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”
Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.
But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.
The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea.”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .
The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted Only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.
“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and every one laughed.
“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.
“There aren’t any more.”
“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe——”
“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”
He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.
“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”
There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me.”—but this time no one laughed.
“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.
“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.
“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.
“What is?”
“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”
“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”
As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.
“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.
“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered, “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”
“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.
“A man named Biloxi. ‘blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”
“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”
“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.
“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use to-day.”
The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea-ea-ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.
“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”
“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”
“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”
“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”
“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”
Jordan smiled.
“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”
Tom and I looked at each other blankly.
“Biloxi?”
“First place, we didn’t have any president——”
Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.
“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”
“Not exactly.”
“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”
“Yes—I went there.”
A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting: “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”
Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but, the silence was unbroken by his “thank you.” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.
“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.
“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”
“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”
Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.
“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”
I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.
Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.
“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”
“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”
“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.
“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”
They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.
“He isn’t causing a row.” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”
“Self-control!” Repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”
Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.
“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.
“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”
Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.
“I’ve got something to tell YOU, old sport——” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.
“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”
“That’s a good idea.” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”
“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”
“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”
“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.
Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.
“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!”
At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.
“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”
“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”
Tom turned to Daisy sharply.
“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”
“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes.”—but there was no laughter in his eyes——” to think that you didn’t know.”
“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.
“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”
“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.
“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”
“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”
Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.
“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.”
She looked at him blindly. “Why — how could I love him — possibly?”
“You never loved him.”
She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late
“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance
“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.
“No.”
From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.
“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone.. .. “Daisy?”
“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said — but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet
“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once — but I loved you too.”
Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed
“You loved me too?” he repeated
“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”
The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby
“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now ——”
“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”
“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom
She turned to her husband
“As if it mattered to you,” she said
“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”
“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”
“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”
“Daisy’s leaving you.”
“Nonsense.”
“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort
“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”
“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”
“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further to-morrow.”
“You can suit yourself about that, old sport.” said Gatsby steadily.
“I found out what your ‘drug-stores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”
“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”
“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU.”
“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”
“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”
That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.
“That drug-store business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”
I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.
It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.
The voice begged again to go.
“PLEASE, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”
Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage, she had had, were definitely gone.
“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”
She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.
“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.”
They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.
After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.
“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?”
I didn’t answer.
“Nick?” He asked again.
“What?”
“Want any?”
“No . . . I just remembered that to-day’s my birthday.”
I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.
It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupe with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.
So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.
“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move away.”
Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.
So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs in the garage.
“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”
A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.
The “death car.” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.
Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.
We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.
“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”
He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.
“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”
I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupe and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.
“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.
He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.
The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.
Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:
“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od!”
Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.
“M-a-y-.” the policeman was saying, “-o——”
“No, r-.” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o——”
“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.
“r” said the policeman, “o——”
“g——”
“g——” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”
“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”
“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”
“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.
“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”
“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”
“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.
“One goin’ each way. Well, she.”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side——” she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’york knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”
“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.
“Hasn’t got any name.”
A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.
“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”
“See the accident?” asked the policeman.
“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”
“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”
Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries:
“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”
Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.
“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.
Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.
“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupe we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”
Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.
“What’s all that?” he demanded.
“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it . . . it was a yellow car.”
Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.
“And what color’s your car?”
“It’s a blue car, a coupe.”
“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.
Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.
“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct——” Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.
“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”
Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.
Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupe raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.
“The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”
The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.
“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.
“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do to-night.”
A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.
“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”
“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”
Jordan put her hand on my arm.
“Won’t you come in, Nick?”
“No, thanks.”
I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.
“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.
I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.
I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.
“What are you doing?” I inquired.
“Just standing here, old sport.”
Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of ‘Wolfshiem’s people,’ behind him in the dark shrubbery.
“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.
“Yes.”
He hesitated.
“Was she killed?”
“Yes.”
“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”
He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.
“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”
I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.
“Who was the woman?” he inquired.
“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”
“Well, I tried to swing the wheel——” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.
“Was Daisy driving?”
“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”
“It ripped her open——”
“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.
“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”
“He won’t touch her,’ I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”
“I don’t trust him, old sport.”
“How long are you going to wait?”
“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”
A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows down-stairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor.
“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”
I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.
Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.
They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.
As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.
“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.
“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”
He shook his head.
“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”
He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.3"

Yo sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer
¿Tú crees que es fácil mirarte a la cara y que me diga':
Yo no, no te conozco? Pues, 'tá to' bien
Tarde o temprano el karma a ti te va a caer, vas a volver
Solita, yo sé que vas a caer
Va a volver a llamarme pa' que te lo vuelva a hacer
Ay, nena, no trate', que no me voy a envolver
Porque dicen, y yo creo, que Lucifer es mujer

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no-no-no-no-no
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos

You ain't cherish shit when you had it
Turn me back to a savage
Grab your stuff while you at it
Now my heart is cold as my Patek, uh
Man, I guess you feel away now
See me on the way up, you on your way down
You had you a ten, but now you a dub
You ain't here, but you wishing you was
You gon' miss grabbing this ass
Now you can miss me with them subs
You don't gotta check on me
'Ca-ca-cause I got a check on me
I don't need nothing from nobody
Not you especially (Let up)
And-and you know that I'm the baddest
Cartier glasses, Fendi fabric
And I'm years away from basic
And I'm miles away from average, but
One thing ain't adding up to me
How you gon' mess with a bitch that look up to me?
Off'
I cannot let up (Let up)
Hug me like a Gucci sweater (Sweater)
Ain't nobody drippin' wetter (Drippin')
I took the time to write a letter (I took the time)
We worked hard out the ghetto
I don't deserve your heart, know you fed up (Nah)
We both had a broken heart when we met up (Eh)
Your body a piece of art, you don't sell it (Uh)
You know that I miss it, I just wanna kiss it
I scroll through the phone, lookin' how we would kick it (Kick it)
Knock at the door, it's a visit (Huh)
She take that shit off then I fuck in the kitchen (Smash)
His and hers, Mr. and Mrs. (Hey)
When I talk to her baby girl listens (Listen)
I had a dream and you was in it (Dream)
When you gone, I feel like I been sinnin'
Come back, come back, come back (Come back)
You not really rich, got the bomb pack (Bomb)
Dive in the water, have fun with that (Dive)
I might put a daughter or son in that (I might)
I bought you a ring and five hundred racks (Hey)
She like the triangle Balenci bag (Drip)
You know you an angel, come save the bad (Angel)
If you really love me then take me back
J Balvin, man

Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth

Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn

You say, Put them on your head! Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You make me un poco loco, un poquititito loco
The way you keep me guessing, I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing
I'll count it as a blessing that I'm only un poco loco

The loco that you make me, it is just un poco crazy
The sense that you're not making
The liberties you're taking
Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco

These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)
Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me

New Faces v2,Mac Miller,"Yeah, mane, you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin' of the song, man, like a damn... rapper
Ah, man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, man, damn

In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When there still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long-distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlinson win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds were enshrouded
I'm out with my face in the shallow end, drownin' again
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in, yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane, it was like Cobain did his last number
Motherfucker
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)
Shallow soul (Um), shallow soul (Yeah)

Yeah, well
Isn't he dizzy off the ups and downs?
He got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now? (Damn,) and I'm
Strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, Slow down
(Down) Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count, my (Woo) (Count my)
Right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik
Me, I'm swervin' in a Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street (Skrrt,) yellin'
Play my shit or wake the baby up! (Wake up)
I get her faded, put it back in her labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always call my phone (Okay)
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war I know
Shout out to Soulo (Soul!), and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of this glory hole (Woah)
Any time, any place, you can bet I'ma eat
'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Woah, look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They comin' on a plane but they're leavin' their suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used to put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics (Woah) ()
Hate myself, fuck the strangers (Woo)
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
(Woah, where it's at) I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies (Fairies,) this could be my last breath
(Last breath) I'ma take my time
(Wait a second, please)
'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind
You are standing in a shallow soul
You are speaking with a shallow soul
Shallow soul
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Will you wash your sins with me?
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
It will set us free
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are standing in a shallow soul

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you

Now what happened?
Well, the cop got
The next morning I went to the store to get some food
(Bread and butter) They arrested me
I'll save you (Thank you)
Would you like a snack?
Thanks for the drink

Operation Doomsday complete
All your intercoms casualty and damage testing

Enough! You talk of the people's rights
The people have only those rights which I choose to give them
And that's for their own good, believe me
I do, DOOM
They disappoint me, they must work faster
But the prisoner-
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him. I have special plans for that one

Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, Aw Hell!
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, Hell no, sell y'all own Jello
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (Food!)
What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude
(We need food!)5"
End/Golden Girl,Frank Ocean,"Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight

Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
You're my golden girl

If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?

If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven

I'ma stay right here, with you

'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes

Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fuckin' with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan

You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there

I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare (Yeah)
In my dreams, in my dreams (Ugh)

I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy has Slave on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't big bro me, don't Big Homie
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you

Feel the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style (Perfect style)
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm (Above the norm)
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal (Fuckin' deal)
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't talk about some money, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow (Would let it slow)
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though (Extra though)

I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Could finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech, they try assassinatin' all of my beliefs
(But I'm asleep) So whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine (Shrine)
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Yeah, can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)

Yeah, don't you ever wanna hide away? (Hide away)
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today (Die today)
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face (Smilin' face)
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' (Keep changin')

And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart

And you shall speak of them when you sit at home

Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact, I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I'm insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
'Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked

You got a nigga-

Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven't talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey, (Fuck you) at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, it's awkward, your name still my password
So I'm always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung

You're my girlfriend... You're my girl (Whether you like it or not!)

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees

BTS - Your eyes tell (English Translation),Genius English Translations,"Why are my eyes filled with tears?
Hey, stay by my side and laugh

A future without you is a world without colour
Filled with monochrome coldness

Even the darkness we see is so beautiful
Please believe me
Looking only directly at you
So you don't go away

Whatever lies in our way
Look far into the distance
The place you gave me is still
Where my heart entrusts

Shadows of the past keep on chasing me
But the more I try to escape and struggle, the more it follows
But I still want to hold onto it, wherever you are I'll find you
To a tomorrow of us
Even it seems to be the beginning of the end
I’ll call your name

The gazing eyes are so colorful
I'll give my everything to you
Still unable to verbalize
The hopeless dream in my heart

To face the past and the future
How much hope is needed to reach you
It's nights like these that I keep on thinking
In the city at dusk

To be loved
To love someone
I'll become your eye
For the adventure that lies ahead

Even the darkness we see is so beautiful
Please believe me

The Great Gatsby (Chapter IX),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.
Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.
But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end.
I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.
“Left no address?”
“No.”
“Say when they’d be back?”
“No.”
“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”
“I don’t know. Can’t say.”
I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you——”
Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.
“Will you ring again?”
“I’ve rung them three times.”
“It’s very important.”
“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”
I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain:
“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”
Some one started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going up-stairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.
Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.
DEAR MR. CARRAWAY. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.
Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM
And then hasty addenda beneath:
Let me know about the funeral etc. do not know his family at all.
When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.
“This is Slagle speaking . . .”
“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.
“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”
“There haven’t been any wires.”
“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns——”
“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”
There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.
I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.
It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse gray beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.
“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”
“I didn’t know how to reach you.” His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.
“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”
“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.
“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.——”
“Carraway.”
“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?” I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.
After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom up-stairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.
“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby——”
“Gatz is my name.”
“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”
He shook his head.
“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”
“We were close friends.”
“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a lot of brain power here.”
He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.
“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”
“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.
He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.
That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name.
“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.
“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.” I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find.
“The funeral’s to-morrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”
“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.”
His tone made me suspicious.
“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”
“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is——”
“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”
“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them to-morrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my very best to get away.”
I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:
“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see, they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.——”
I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.
After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known better than to call him.
The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be any one inside. But when I’d shouted “hello.” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.
“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”
The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.
“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”
“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”
At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.
“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he gets back.”
“But I know he’s there.”
She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.
“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”
I mentioned Gatsby.
“Oh—h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your name?”
She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.
“My memory goes back to when I first met him,” he said. “A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I sid. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”
“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.
“Start him! I made him.”
“Oh.”
“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything.”—-he held up two bulbous fingers——” always together.”
I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.
“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”
“I’d like to come.”
“Well, come then.”
The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.
“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.
“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”
“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”
I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.
“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.
For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.
“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”
When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.
“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. “Look there.”
It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.
“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.”
“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”
“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.” He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy.
“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.”
He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word Schedule, and the date September 12, 1906, and underneath:
Rise from bed................ 6.00 a.m
Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling...... 6.15-6.30 ”

General Resolves No wasting time at Shafters or  No more smokeing or chewing Bath every other day Read one improving book or magazine per week Save $5.00 {crossed out} $3.00 per week Be better to parents
“I come across this book by accident,” said the old man. “It just shows you, don’t it?”
“It just shows you.”
“Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.”
He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.
A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.
About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate — first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.
I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.
I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur, “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.
We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.
“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.
“Neither could anybody else.”
“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.” He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.
“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.
One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-that’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.
When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.
That’s my Middle West — not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all — Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.
Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old — even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house — the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.
After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.
There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.
She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say good-bye.
“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”
We shook hands.
“Oh, and do you remember.”—she added——” a conversation we had once about driving a car?”
“Why—not exactly.”
“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”
“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.”
She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.
One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.
What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?
Yes. You know what I think of you.
You're crazy, Nick, he said quickly. Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you.
Tom, I inquired, what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?
He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.
I told him the truth, he said. He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house-- He broke off defiantly. What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did Daisy's, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car.
There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true.
And you think I didn't have my suffering--look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on that sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful--
I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...
I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.
Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left — the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.
I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.
On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.
Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes — a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.
And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning ——
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.2"

Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

Fuori è chiaro anche se è notte e ci sarà la neve
Io me ne sarò andato svelto senza dire niente
Nelle orecchie non ho più il suono delle sirene
Tira piano, il fumo passa dalle tapparelle
Non discuto con l'agente, vuole informazioni
Io non sono l'anagrafe, non li faccio i nomi
Prego il cielo mentre fumo, vedo arcobaleni
Infatti Dio sa che le ho combinate di tutti i colori
E so che (Benz) no, non è domenica
Ma tutti i miei sognano una domenica da Dio
Quasi meritata dopo anni passati nell'oblio
Ma tu che ne sai di interni di plastica di una Clio?
Sento plastica nelle cose che dicono
Io ci salto i pasti per le cose che ti dico mo
Farai sempre male a non fidarti di un amico
Ad affidarti a dei bastardi a cui non piaci di principio
Quindi sai che se
Parlo solo di soldi perché i miei drammi più grandi
Non ho nemmeno coraggio di raccontarli (Benz)
Tieni sempre gli occhi aperti quando giri gli angoli
Il destino è li che tira i fili, vuole che ti strangoli
Non dare corda a questi visi pallidi e stanchi
La partita la perdi quando sei al pari degli altri
Perderanno i tuoi nemici col passare degli anni
Io perdono i miei nemici, servirà a depistarli, ma oh

Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto (Benz)
Come scorre un fiume di parole (Sì)
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore (Sì)
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto (Yeah)
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto (Benz)
Come scorre un fiume di parole (Sì)
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore (Sì)
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto (Yeah)
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto
Ho fatto un disco d'oro con un disco d'odio
Vedi il vuoto nel mio sguardo fisso perché ambisco al podio
Tu vuoi solo il tête-à-tête, lo capisco al volo
Vorrei darti il vecchio me ma preferisco il nuovo
E sono stanco ormai di correre
Di pensare che ogni bastardo mi voglia fottere
In parole povere
Son stanco di vedere che ti parlo e non mi stai ascoltando
Ma aspettando per rispondere, che cazzo!
Mi aspetta una staffetta illimitata
Ma so già che la mia vetta è meritata
Di notte vedo mostri con la faccia ribaltata
La vendetta privata in una cassetta piratata
Poi la luce si fa fioca, la pupilla dilatata
Per i soldi, per la droga e per la vita dilaniata
Vorrei che tu vedessi con che faccia disperata
Mi guarda mia mamma quando me ne vado via di casa
Fanculo!
Quando ci si guarda dentro, qui non ride più nessuno
E devo stare attento
Per uscire in tempo da questo tunnel buio
Perché mi hanno detto che pensare uccide più del fumo
E non pensare che non sia sensibile
Ma me ne frego di quello che credi sia credibile
Ti sei mai chiesto quanto sia difficile decidere se
Vivere per scrivere o se scrivere per vivere? (Eh!?)
Ma l'uomo è un animale e devi urlare più forte
Se non vuoi diventare il suo giullare di corte
Per imparare qui devi sbagliare un quintale di volte
E provare ad andare oltre
Tu non ragionare ad onde corte, non si può spiegare il no-sense
Allungare gambe corte, raddrizzare piante storte
Anteporre il male e ignorare quanto sangue scorre
La mia vita è un cortometraggio, racconto di un saggio
Dove il protagonista sembra morto nel viaggio
Ti ho già perso di vista
Mentre affondo tra il fango, il rimorso, il rimpianto
Ogni giorno m'incazzo
Pur di non tenere addosso il volto del falso
È un problema grosso e non hai colto il messaggio
Se crollo mi rialzo e mi prendo 'sto mondo del cazzo
Se è vero che

Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto a posto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto1"

The Great Gatsby (Chapter V),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.
At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.
“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.
“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”
“It’s too late.”
“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”
“I’ve got to go to bed.”
“All right.”
He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.
“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite her over here to tea.”
“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”
“What day would suit you?”
“What day would suit YOU?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”
“How about the day after to-morrow?” He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance:
“I want to get the grass cut,” he said.
We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.
“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.
“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.
“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least——” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”
“Not very much.”
This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.
“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”
“Trying to.”
“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”
I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.
“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”
“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.
The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms.” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.
“Don’t bring Tom, I warned her.
“What?”
“Don’t bring Tom.”
“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.
The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy, whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.
The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.
“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.
“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”
“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.
“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the JOURNAL. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”
I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.
“Will they do?” I asked.
“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “. . .old sport.”
The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s ECONOMICS, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.
“Why’s that?”
“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all day.”
“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”
He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.
Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.
“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”
The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.
“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”
“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”
“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”
“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”
“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”
We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.
“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.
“What’s funny?”
She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.
With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.
For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note: “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”
A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.
Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair.
“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.
“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.
My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.
“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.
I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.
“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.
“Five years next November.”
The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.
Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.
“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.
“I’ll be back.”
“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”
He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered:
“Oh, God!” in a miserable way.
“What’s the matter?”
“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”
“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”
“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.
“Just as much as you are.”
“Don’t talk so loud.”
“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”
He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.
I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small, muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period.” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.
After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.
I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.
“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.
“It’s stopped raining.”
“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”
“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.
“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”
“You’re sure you want me to come?”
“Absolutely, old sport.”
Daisy went up-stairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.
“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”
I agreed that it was splendid.
“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”
“I thought you inherited your money.”
“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic — the panic of the war.”
I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered, “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t the appropriate reply
“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”
Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight
“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.
“Do you like it?”
“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”
“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”
Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.
And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library.” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.
We went up-stairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths — intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.
He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.
His bedroom was the simplest room of all — except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.
“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t — When I try to ——”
He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.
Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.
“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”
He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher — shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.
“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such — such beautiful shirts before.”
After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming-pool, and the hydroplane and the mid-summer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.
“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,” said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.”
Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.
“Who’s this?”
“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”
The name sounded faintly familiar.
“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”
There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.
“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”
“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.”
They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.
“Yes. . . . well, I can’t talk now. . . . I can’t talk now, old sport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . he must know what a small town is. . . . well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town. . . .”
He rang off.
“Come here QUICK!” cried Daisy at the window.
The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.
“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”
I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.
“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”
He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.
“Did we interrupt your exercises?” inquired Daisy politely.
“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .”
“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”
“I don’t play well. I don’t—I hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac——”
“We’ll go down-stairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The gray windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.
In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.
When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest, he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.
“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac ——”
“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”
“In the morning
In the evening
Ain’t we got fun——”
Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.
“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer
The rich get richer and the poor get— children
In the meantime
In between time——”
As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams — not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.
As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed — that voice was a deathless song.
They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.2"

Hope you feel alright, yeah2"
The Great Gatsby (Chapter II),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes — a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it,  you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic — their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.
The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.
The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.
“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”
I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.
I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.
The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.
“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. “How’s business?”
“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell me that car?”
“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”
“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”
“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”
“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant——”
His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:
“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”
“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.
“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”
“All right.”
“I’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.” She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.
We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a gray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.
“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.
“Awful.”
“It does her good to get away.”
“Doesn’t her husband object?”
“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”
So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.
She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of TOWN TATTLE. and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drug-store some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with gray upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.
“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”
We backed up to a gray old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.
“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.
“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”
“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”
The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.
“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.
“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”
“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”
“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”
The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.
“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.
“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”
“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”
We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.
“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”
“No, you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly.
“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”
“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”
“Well, I’d like to, but——”
We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.
“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”
The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of TOWN TATTLE. lay on the table together with a copy of SIMON CALLED PETER, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.
I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of SIMON CALLED PETER.—either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.
Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment-door.
The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eye-brows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.
Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to every one in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.
Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.
“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”
“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.
“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”
“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”
Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.
“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”
“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”
We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.
“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”
“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s——”
Her husband said “SH!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.
“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”
“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”
She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.
“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.
Tom looked at him blankly.
“Two of them we have framed down-stairs.”
“Two what?” demanded Tom.
“Two studies. One of them I call MONTAUK POINT—THE GULLS, and the other I call MONTAUK POINT—THE SEA.”
The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.
“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.
“I live at West Egg.”
“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”
“I live next door to him.”
“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”
“Really?”
She nodded.
“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”
This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:
“Chester, I think you could do something with HER,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.
“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”
“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you Myrtle?”
“Do what?” she asked, startled.
“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented. “GEORGE B. WILSON AT THE GASOLINE PUMP, or something like that.”
Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: “Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”
“Can’t they?”
“Can’t STAND them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”
“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”
The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.
“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”
Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.
“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.”
“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”
“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”
“Really.”
“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.” “Stay long?”
“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”
The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.
“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kyke who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s ‘way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”
“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.”
“I know I didn’t.”
“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”
“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”
Myrtle considered.
“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”
“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.
“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”
She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.
“The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out. Oh, is that your suit? I said. This is the first I ever heard about it. But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”
“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me. “They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”
The bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk southward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.
“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’”
She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.
“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one to-morrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”
It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.
The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face, discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name
Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! shouted Mrs. Wilson. I'll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai--
Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand
Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone halfway he turned and started at the scene- his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.
“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.
“Where?”
“Anywhere.”
“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”
“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”
. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.
“Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . . Brook’n Bridge . . . .”
Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning TRIBUNE, and waiting for the four o’clock train.3"

BLACK EFFECT,THE CARTERS,"Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say that again

The Great Gatsby (Chapter IV),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.
“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”
Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the gray names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.
From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.
Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.
From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut.”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.
A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as “the boarder.”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.
Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.
In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.
All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.
At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.
“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me to-day and I thought we’d ride up together.”
He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.
He saw me looking with admiration at his car.
“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”
I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.
I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say: So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.
And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.
“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly. “What’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”
A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.
“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”
So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.
“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West — all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”
He looked at me sideways — and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all
“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.
“San Francisco.”
“I see.”
“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”
His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.
“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe — Paris, Venice, Rome — collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”
With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne
“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration — even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”
Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them — with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines
He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.
“That’s the one from Montenegro.”
To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look
“Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”
“Turn it.”
“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”
“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad — the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.”
It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger — with a cricket bat in his hand.
Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.
“I’m going to make a big request of you to-day,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”
“At lunch?”
“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”
“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”
“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”
I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.
He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.
With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Long Island City — only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug — jug — spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.
“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.
“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”
“What was that?” I inquired.
“The picture of Oxford?”
“I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”
Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.
“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “Anything at all....”
Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.
Roaring noon. In a well—fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.
“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”
A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.
“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”
“What?” I inquired politely.
But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.
“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid: ‘all right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”
Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.
“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.
“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”
“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.”
“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”
“What place is that?” I asked.
“The old Metropole.
“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘all right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.
“‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’
“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”
“Did he go?” I asked innocently.
“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”
“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.
“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”
The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:
“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”
“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.
“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.”
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”
A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.
“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.”
There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.
“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered. “And I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”
“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”
Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.
“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”
“Yes.”
“He’s an Oggsford man.”
“Oh!”
“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”
“I’ve heard of it.”
“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”
“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.
“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’.” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.” I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.
They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.
“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.
“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”
“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”
When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.
“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”
“Don’t hurry, Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.
“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your——” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”
As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.
“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”
“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”
“No.”
“A dentist?”
“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”
“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.
The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.
“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.
“He just saw the opportunity.”
“Why isn’t he in jail?”
“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”
I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.
“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to some one.” When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.
“Where’ve you been?” he demamded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”
“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”
They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.
“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”
“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”
I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.
One October day in nineteen-seventeen——
(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)
—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a disapproving way.
The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”
When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away.
“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.
That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say good-by to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.
By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. she had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.
“‘Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”
“What’s the matter, Daisy?”
I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.
“Here, deares’.” She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em down-stairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’.”
She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.
But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.
The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers. . . .
Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.
* * *
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:
“I’m the Sheik of Araby.
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you’re are asleep
Into your tent I’ll creep——”
“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.
“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”
“Why not?”
“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”
Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.
“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.”
The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he could “come over.” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.
“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”
“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he’s a regular tough underneath it all.”
Something worried me.
“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”
“He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is right next door.”
“Oh!”
“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:
“‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’
“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”
It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”
“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to me.
“Does she want to see Gatsby?”
“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re just supposed to invite her to tea.”
We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.1"

Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other5"

DEARLY DEPARTED,BROCKHAMPTON,"I pray I find you at the bottom of the hill
I  pray I make it outta Texas
I  pray my A/C come back on
My mom was stuck outside her job
My sister just asked for a Lexus
Can  Jesus send me a message?
What's  the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
World don't view my text messages
World  don't view my text messages
Don't view my bad side
Only get on the 'Gram to show you motherfuckers the best side
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Why  I hide? Huh
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA‚ that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies‚ it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells

Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows‚ truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high‚ expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)
How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker3"

Of Mice and Men: Chapter 1,John Steinbeck,"ONE
A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan Mountains, but on the valley side the water is lined with trees- willows fresh and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winter's flooding; and sycamores with mottled, white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool. On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them.Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of 'coons, and with the spread pads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split-wedge tracks of deer that come to drink in the dark.
There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungle-up near water. In front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it.
Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the leaves. The shade climbed up the hills toward the top. On the sand banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones. And then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried noiselessly for cover. A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down river. For a moment the place was lifeless, and then two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green pool.
They had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open one stayed behind the other. Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, and wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.
The first man stopped short in the clearing, and the follower nearly ran over him. He took off his hat and wiped the sweat-band with his forefinger and snapped the moisture off. His huge companion dropped his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of the green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into the water like a horse. The small man stepped nervously beside him.
Lennie! he said sharply. Lennie, for God' sakes don't drink so much. Lennie continued to snort into the pool. The small man leaned over and shook him by the shoulder. Lennie. You gonna be sick like you was last night.
Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back. Tha's good, he said. You drink some, George. You take a good big drink. He smiled happily.
George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank. I ain't sure it's good water, he said. Looks kinda scummy.
Lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool to the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. Look, George. Look what I done.
George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick scoops. Tastes all right, he admitted. Don't really seem to be running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain't running, Lennie, he said hopelessly. You'd drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty. He threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back of his neck. Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from the river, drew up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had been watching, imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see whether he had it just right. He pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes, the way George's hat was.
George stared morosely at the water. The rims of his eyes were red with sun glare. He said angrily, We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin' about. 'Jes' a little stretch down the highway,' he says. 'Jes' a little stretch.' God damn near four miles, that's what it was! Didn't wanta stop at the ranch gate, that's what. Too God damn lazy to pull up. Wonder he isn't too damn good to stop in Soledad at all. Kicks us out and says 'Jes' a little stretch down the road.' I bet it was more than four miles. Damn hot day.
Lennie looked timidly over to him. George?
Yeah, what ya want?
Where we goin', George?
The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over at Lennie. So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? , you're a crazy bastard!
I forgot, Lennie said softly. I tried not to forget. Honest to God I did, George.
O.K.- O.K. I'll tell ya again. I ain't got nothing to do. Mightjus' as well spen' all my time tellin' you things and then you forget 'em, and I tell you again.
Tried and tried, said Lennie, but it didn't do no good. I remember about the rabbits, George.
The hell with the rabbits. That's all you ever can remember is them rabbits. O.K.! Now you listen and this time you got to remember so we don't get in no trouble. You remember settin' in that gutter on Howard Street and watchin' that blackboard?
Lennie's face broke into a delighted smile. Why sure, George. I remember that... but... what'd we do then? I remember some girls come by and you says... you says...
The hell with what I says. You remember about us goin' in to Murray and Ready's, and they give us work cards and bus tickets?
Oh, sure, George. I remember that now. His hands went quickly into his side coat pockets. He said gently, George... I ain't got mine. I musta lost it. He looked down at the ground in despair.
You never had none, you crazy bastard. I got both of 'em here. Think I'd let you carry your own work card?
Lennie grinned with relief. I... I thought I put it in my side pocket. His hand went into the pocket again.
George looked sharply at him. What'd you take outa that pocket?
Ain't a thing in my pocket, Lennie said cleverly.
I know there ain't. You got it in your hand. What you got in your hand- hidin' it?
I ain't got nothin', George. Honest.
Come on, give it here.
Lennie held his closed hand away from George's direction. It's on'y a mouse, George.
A mouse? A live mouse?
Uh-uh. Jus' a dead mouse, George. I didn't kill it. Honest! I found it. I found it dead.
Give it here! said George.
Aw, leave me have it, George.
Give it here!
Lennie's closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. What you want of a dead mouse, anyways?
I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along, said Lennie.
Well, you ain't petting no mice while you walk with me. You remember where we're goin' now?
Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face against his knees. I forgot again.
Jesus Christ, George said resignedly. Well- look, we're gonna work on a ranch like the one we come from up north.
Up north?
In Weed.
Oh, sure. I remember. In Weed.
That ranch we're goin' to is right down there about a quarter mile. We're gonna go in an' see the boss. Now, look- I'll give him the work tickets, but you ain't gonna say a word. You jus' stand there and don't say nothing. If he finds out what a crazy bastard you are, we won't get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk, we're set. Ya got that?
Sure, George. Sure I got it.
O.K. Now when we go in to see the boss, what you gonna do?
I... I... Lennie thought. His face grew tight with thought.
I... ain't gonna say nothin'. Jus' gonna stan' there.
Good boy. That's swell. You say that over two, three times so you sure won't forget it.
Lennie droned to himself softly, I ain't gonna say nothin'... I
ain't gonna say nothin'... I ain't gonna say nothin'.
O.K., said George. An' you ain't gonna do no bad things like
you done in Weed, neither.
Lennie looked puzzled. Like I done in Weed?
Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya? Well, I ain't gonna remind ya,
fear ya do it again.
A light of understanding broke on Lennie's face. They run us outa
Weed, he exploded triumphantly.
Run us out, hell, said George disgustedly. We run. They was
lookin' for us, but they didn't catch us.
Lennie giggled happily. I didn't forget that, you bet.
George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he was doing it right. God, you're a lot of trouble, said George. I could get along so easy and so nice if I didn't have you on my tail. I could live so easy and maybe have a girl.
For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, We gonna work on a ranch, George.
Awright. You got that. But we're gonna sleep here because I got a
reason.
The day was going fast now. Only the tops of the Gabilan Mountains flamed with the light of the sun that had gone from the valley. A water snake slipped along on the pool, its head held up like a little periscope. The reeds jerked slightly in the current. Far off toward the highway a man shouted something, and another man shouted back. The sycamore limbs rustled under a little wind that died immediately.
George- why ain't we goin' on to the ranch and get some supper?
They got supper at the ranch.
George rolled on his side. No reason at all for you. I like it here. Tomorra we're gonna go to work. I seen thrashin' machines on the way down. That means we'll be buckin' grain bags, bustin' a gut.
Tonight I'm gonna lay right here and look up. I like it.
Lennie got up on his knees and looked down at George. Ain't we
gonna have no supper?
Sure we are, if you gather up some dead willow sticks. I got three cans of beans in my bindle. You get a fire ready. I'll give you a match when you get the sticks together. Then we'll heat the beans and have supper.
Lennie said, I like beans with ketchup.
Well, we ain't got no ketchup. You go get wood. An' don't you fool around. It'll be dark before long.
Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped whistling and listened. Poor bastard, he said softly, and then went on whistling again.
In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He
carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up.
Awright, he said brusquely. Gi'me that mouse!
But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. What mouse, George? I ain't got no mouse.
George held out his hand. Come on. Give it to me. You ain't puttin' nothing over.
Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as
though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said coldly,
You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?
Give you what, George?
You know God damn well what. I want that mouse.
Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a
little. I don't know why I can't keep it. It ain't nobody's mouse.
I didn't steal it. I found it lyin' right beside the road.
George's hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a
terrier who doesn't want to bring a ball to its master, Lennie
approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.
I wasn't doin' nothing bad with it, George. Jus' strokin' it.
George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the
darkening brush, and then he stepped to the pool and washed his hands. You crazy fool. Don't you think I could see your feet was wet where you went acrost the river to get it? He heard Lennie's whimpering cry and wheeled about. Blubberin' like a baby! Jesus Christ! A big guy like you. Lennie's lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. Aw, Lennie! George put his hand on Lennie's shoulder. I ain't takin' it away jus' for meanness. That mouse ain't fresh, Lennie; and besides, you've broke it pettin' it. You get another mouse that's fresh and I'll let you keep it a little while.
Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. I don't know where there is no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give 'em to me- ever' one she got. But that lady ain't here.
George scoffed. Lady, huh? Don't even remember who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An' she stopped givin' 'em to ya. You always killed 'em.
Lennie looked sadly up at him. They was so little, he said, apologetically. I'd pet 'em, and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead-because they was so little.
I wisht we'd get the rabbits pretty soon, George. They ain't so
little.
The hell with the rabbits. An' you ain't to be trusted with no live
mice. Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn't have nothing to do with it.
It wasn't no good to pet, said Lennie.
The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountaintops and dusk came into the valley, and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores. A big carp rose to the surface of the pool, gulped air and then sank mysteriously into the dark water again, leaving widening rings on the water. Overhead the leaves whisked again and little puffs of willow cotton blew down and landed on the pool's surface.
You gonna get that wood? George demanded. There's plenty right up against the back of that sycamore. Floodwater wood. Now you get it.
Lennie went behind the tree and brought out a litter of dried leaves and twigs. He threw them in a heap on the old ash pile and went back for more and more. It was almost night now. A dove's wings whistled over the water. George walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves. The flame cracked up among the twigs and fell to work. George undid his bindle and brought out three cans of beans. He stood them about the fire, close in against the blaze, but not quite touching the flame.
There's enough beans for four men, George said.
Lennie watched him from over the fire. He said patiently, I like 'em with ketchup.
Well, we ain't got any, George exploded. Whatever we ain't got,
that's what you want. God a'mighty, if I was alone I could live so
easy. I could go get a job an' work, an' no trouble. No mess at all,
and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I want. Why, I could stay in a cat house all night. I could eat any place I want, hotel or any place, and order any damn thing I could think of. An' I could do all that every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool. Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George. And Lennie's face was drawn with terror. An' whatta I got, George went on furiously. I got you! You can't keep a job and you lose me ever' job I get. Jus' keep me shovin' all over the country all the time. An' that ain't the worst. You get in trouble. You do bad things and I got to get you out. His voice rose nearly to a shout.
You crazy son-of-a-bitch. You keep me in hot water all the time.
He took on the elaborate manner of little girls when they are
mimicking one another. Jus' wanted to feel that girl's dress- jus'
wanted to pet it like it was a mouse- Well, how the hell did she
know you jus' wanted to feel her dress? She jerks back and you hold on like it was a mouse. She yells and we got to hide in a irrigation ditch all day with guys lookin' for us, and we got to sneak out in the dark and get outa the country. All the time somethin' like that- all the time. I wisht I could put you in a cage with about a million mice an' let you have fun. His anger left him suddenly. He looked across the fire at Lennie's anguished face, and then he looked ashamedly at the flames.
It was quite dark now, but the fire lighted the trunks of the trees and the curving branches overhead. Lennie crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until he was close to George. He sat back on his heels. George turned the bean cans so that another side faced the fire. He pretended to be unaware of Lennie so close beside him.
George, very softly. No answer. George!
Whatta you want?
I was only foolin', George. I don't want no ketchup. I wouldn't eat
no ketchup if it was right here beside me.
If it was here, you could have some.
But I wouldn't eat none, George. I'd leave it all for you. You could cover your beans with it and I wouldn't touch none of it.
George still stared morosely at the fire. When I think of the swell
time I could have without you, I go nuts. I never get no peace.
Lennie still knelt. He looked off into the darkness across the river. George, you want I should go away and leave you alone?
Where the hell could you go?
Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some place I'd find a cave.
Yeah? How'd you eat? You ain't got sense enough to find nothing to eat.
I'd find things, George. I don't need no nice food with ketchup.
I'd lay out in the sun and nobody'd hurt me. An' if I foun' a mouse, I could keep it. Nobody'd take it away from me.
George looked quickly and searchingly at him. I been mean, ain't
I?
If you don' want me I can go off in the hills an' find a cave. I can go away any time.
No- look! I was jus' foolin', Lennie. Cause I want you to stay
with me. Trouble with mice is you always kill 'em. He paused. Tell you what I'll do, Lennie. First chance I get I'll give you a pup. Maybe you wouldn't kill it. That'd be better than mice. And you could pet it harder.
Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage. If you don't want me, you only jus' got to say so, and I'll go off in those hills right there- right up in those hills and live by myself. An' I won't get no mice stole from me.
George said, I want you to stay with me, Lennie. Jesus Christ,
somebody'd shoot you for a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you stay with me. Your Aunt Clara wouldn't like you running off by yourself, even if she is dead.
Lennie spoke craftily, Tell me- like you done before.
Tell you what?
About the rabbits.
George snapped, You ain't gonna put nothing over on me. Lennie pleaded, Come on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like you done before.
You get a kick outa that, don't you? Awright, I'll tell you, and then we'll eat our supper....
George's voice became deeper. He repeated his words rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no fambly. They don't belong no place. They come to a ranch an' work up a stake and then they go into town and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they're poundin' their tail on some other ranch. They ain't got nothing to look ahead to.
Lennie was delighted. That's it- that's it. Now tell how it is with us.
George went on. With us it ain't like that. We got a future. We got
somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don't have to sit in no bar room blowin' in our jack jus' because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.
Lennie broke in. But not us! An' why? Because... because I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that's why. He laughed delightedly. Go on now, George!
You got it by heart. You can do it yourself.
No, you. I forget some a' the things. Tell about how it's gonna be.
O.K. Someday- we're gonna get the jack together and we're gonna have a little house and a couple of acres an' a cow and some pigs and-
An' live off the fatta the lan', Lennie shouted. An' have rabbits. Go on, George! Tell about what we're gonna have in the garden and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is on the milk like you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George.
Why'n't you do it yourself? You know all of it.
No... you tell it. It ain't the same if I tell it. Go on... George. How I get to tend the rabbits.
Well, said George, we'll have a big vegetable patch and a rabbit hutch and chickens. And when it rains in the winter, we'll just say the hell with goin' to work, and we'll build up a fire in the stove and set around it an' listen to the rain comin' down on the roof- Nuts! He took out his pocket knife. I ain't got time for no more. He drove his knife through the top of one of the bean cans, sawed out the top and passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons and passed one of them to Lennie.
They sat by the fire and filled their mouths with beans and chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out of the side of Lennie's mouth. George gestured with his spoon. What you gonna say tomorrow when the boss asks you questions?
Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His face was concentrated. I... I ain't gonna... say a word.
Good boy! That's fine, Lennie! Maybe you're gettin' better. When we get the coupla acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right. 'Specially if you remember as good as that.
Lennie choked with pride. I can remember, he said.
George motioned with his spoon again. Look, Lennie. I want you to look around here. You can remember this place, can't you? The ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just follow the river?
Sure, said Lennie. I can remember this. Di'n't I remember about
not gonna say a word?
'Course you did. Well, look. Lennie- if you jus' happen to get in
trouble like you always done before, I want you to come right here an' hide in the brush.
Hide in the brush, said Lennie slowly.
Hide in the brush till I come for you. Can you remember that?
Sure I can, George. Hide in the brush till you come.
But you ain't gonna get in no trouble, because if you do, I won't let you tend the rabbits. He threw his empty bean can off into the
brush.
I won't get in no trouble, George. I ain't gonna say a word.
O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It's gonna be nice
sleepin' here. Lookin' up, and the leaves. Don't build up no more
fire. We'll let her die down.
They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze dropped from
the fire the sphere of light grew smaller; the curling branches disappeared and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, George- you asleep?
No. Whatta you want?
Let's have different color rabbits, George.
Sure we will, George said sleepily. Red and blue and green
rabbits, Lennie. Millions of 'em.
Furry ones, George, like I seen in the fair in Sacramento.
Sure, furry ones.
Cause I can jus' as well go away, George, an' live in a cave.
You can jus' as well go to hell, said George. Shut up now.
The red light dimmed on the coals. Up the hill from the river a coyote yammered, and a dog answered from the other side of the stream.
The sycamore leaves whispered in a little night breeze.11"

Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa

What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate
Shit-faced, get this straight, this is truck wheels, deck, grip tape

Ride to the dinner tapin'

Rusherking3"
If I Had,Eminem,"Life, by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', Where hip-hop lives
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just fed up, that's my word5"
Drew Barrymore,Bryce Vine,"I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
With nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple color lip-gloss
Room at The Saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in, oh
For I get way too adamant about it
Love the way you shiver
Dig in to my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliette
Legends never die
The TV hasn't worked in ages
Probably got a shorted cable
Way too busy fuckin' on the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy?
You look like you're someone famous
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for, yeah

'Cause you're something like the summer
Kinda like a hurricane
Sweepin' through the desert
Hot Americana rain fallin'
Wearing nothing but my Lauryn Hill shirt
It's kinda baggy on you, baby, but it work
The AC hasn't worked in ages
I could probably read the label
Way too busy fuckin' on the counter or the coffee table
Am I hallucinating?
Why do you look hella famous?

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
I wanna make
Every single moment for you great
Fly away to Cairo or LA
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time, waste time
I wanna make, yeah
Every single moment for you great, yeah
Fly away to Cairo or LA
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)

Big Amount,2 Chainz,"I'ma tell you, I'ma tell you this right now
If you, if you woke up this mornin', nigga you winnin' for real
(Buddah Bless this beat)

I got a big amount, I took a different route
I am the pick of the litter
I was in juvy, they gave me community
I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double-cross on these bitches, yeah
Dearly departed, gather today
On some Prince shit
You know what they say
Me and my safe, got a friendship
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid
Bitch made, took off sick days
6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat-downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Blackout when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, Pick a fur
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
'Cause these niggas actin' too fishy
Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah

Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, You bad and you know it
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow
Yeah, yeah2"

Right time at the right moment
It's you

I'd give up everything I have, girl, just for you
I'm tryna hold back, you oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast deeply in love

BTS - Lights (English Translation),Genius English Translations,"Sunday, when I can't answer any calls or texts
I'm not in the mood for anything
Though not very often, I feel sick of it
I feel a little helpless right now

But I still feel like I can save someone
I hear your voice
Within the noise, time stops
We are connected by sound, woah

When I close my eyes
In the darkness, your light woah
Lights the way for me
We can walk forward without fear, you & I, woah

You're my light you're my light
Always shine into my heart
You're my light you're my light
No matter how far apart we are
Your light shines on me

All the angels who know pain
Flying on damaged wings through the night
Every time I'm thinking about love
Every time I'm thinking about love
I don't wanna listen to just happy songs
I'll face my loneliness, color my life
Losing and gaining, but I'm still searching for something today
Yeah I believe that things will change
No one is perfect
Even this moment has its own meaning
And we are connected by sound, woah

When you close your eyes
In the darkness, my light woah
Lights the way for you
Let's walk forward without fear,  you & I woah

I'm your light I'm your light
Always shine into your heart
I'm your light I'm your light
No matter how far apart we are
Your light shines on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

I never thought there'd be a sleepless night
Turns out they weren't lies
And it made me get stronger
What is love? If there's an answer, I wanna know right now
I'm breaking down I can see there's light inside
Dawn will come to the darkest of nights
Overcome, even the future
We won't stop from now on
Decide for yourself what it means to be happy
Every day, take a step to grow up
But it's okay sometimes
To show weakness
It's okay to be you
Don't lie to yourself any more
Everything connects by sound, woah

When I close my eyes
In the darkness, your light woah
Lights the way for me
We can walk forward without fear, you & I woah

You're my light, you're my light
Always shine into my heart
You're my light, you're my light
No matter how far apart we are
Your light shines on me

No matter how far apart we are
Your light shines on me1"

On pourra convaincre tout l'monde qu'on a changé mais jamais soi-même
Verse un peu de sang pour rougir le bouton
Hashtag loup-garou sous la peau de mouton (quoi ?)
Sous le masque du gentil Fianso, c'était moi
Tu prêtes pas l'allégeance, on t'arrache ta mère
C'est Lord Voldemort, inutile de mentir
J'arrive sur l'industrie à dos de Pégase pour charmer les sorciers, boire le sang des vampires
Pardonnez les Hobbits du haut de ma tour (humble)
Le contact à l'antimatière (tragique)
Ramène pas les condés dans l'four (simple)
Frère, on va t'niquer ta mère (basique)
Cartel de Cali, quelle boulette de shit ? On t'apporte la Géode
Y'a qu'un seul parrain pour toute l'Italie
Au 33 du rite écossais, #MacLeod
Je suis l'abscisse, désordonné
Scritch et moi-même pour glisser dans l'panneau
Égorge un agneau, mesure la secousse
Un cercle, un anneau pour les gouverner tous
J'ai lu mon avenir dans un litron d're-pu
En famille qu'on saigne, en famille qu'on gagne
Choisis autre chose qui n'se rencontre pas
Je suis un kabyle, je viens des montagnes (check)
Rafale dans qamis, on boit des Kbis, les abysses m'accompagnent
Patate dans Batman sans accessoires ou d'cape
Ton blase sur ma liste noire et fin d'l'histoire, coup d'pompes
J'vis sans coloris, des ennemis trop lents
Transac' droguée, le remix, faire l'deal
Une baguette magique, un balai volant, pfff, Glock, GSX-R1000
J'ai dit endolori, j'allume à bout touchant
Sous la Lune, le couchant, j'ai les impacts au torse
De bonne manufacture, Go Go Gadgeto-pompe
Chevrotine Transformers chez General Motors
Et tôt ou tard, le Prince devient l'ennemi du Roi, j'vais m'asseoir mais t'as déconné
J'ai le goût du pouvoir, du huitième et tu croyais m'avoir mais j'suis désolé
Fianso
Mon p'tit loup, mon p'tit loup, reste pas là, ça devient chelou
Mon p'tit loup, mon p'tit loup, éloigne-toi, y'a un loup-garou
Mon p'tit loup, mon p'tit loup, reste pas là, ça devient chelou
Je vais te briser l'cou
Parce que la vie m'a mis des coups et qu'j'arrête pas d'me prendre la tête avec des gens qui pensent me connaître comme mes parents, ouais, j'suis paro
J'manifeste peu d'amour, j'ai toujours pas trouvé les mots
C'est Waraoui ou Warano ?
Dis-moi, y'a quoi après la mort ?
C'est la fuego, les dinero ; c'est le uno mon numéro
Pour Adama Diallo poulo, on a commencé ça sous l'eau
Sous l'eau, solo dans le zoo, éviter la zonz, neuvième était la zone, et ça gratte à la maison
Ça devient très très grave, le démon se branle quand les Hommes s'égarent
Restons sur nos gardes, j'pense pas qu'on soit dans un sketch de Gad
Tu t'appelles Agathe, laisse-moi te dire qu'les câlins, ça m'gave
Et les hommes aiment voir que les jambes s'écartent et que tout se gâte comme à Kattegat
Ok, dis-moi, qu'est-ce tu veux ?
À défaut d'te dire : Enfoiré, qu'est-ce tu vaux ?
Un peu d'oseille pour éprouver ta go
Dégagez l'passage, voilà Gustavo
On va pas s'mytho, dire que tout est beau
J'te dirai qui t'es si tu vides tes poches
Allez, manque de pot, tu t'appelles Sakho
Et, là, forcément, c'est la classe éco'
Je n'ai jamais baissé mon pantalon, je n'ai jamais mis de talons, je vais te casser les phalanges
Tu verras comment c'est marrant, j'suis gaulé comme un étalon, le baron daron des darons, est-ce que tu m'suis ?
Viens, on parle sur WhatsApp, j'suis sur écoute, mieux vaut chuchoter
Le manager a anticipé que la petite garce allait screenshoter
Eeeh oh, c'est moi, celui qu'la SACEM ne peut plus payer
Français, Françaises, j'arrive en paix, 190K sur le poignet
T'es venu au monde avant la honte
J'te donne l'heure, tu veux prendre la montre
Les Vineurs deviennent des chanteurs
On va pas s'gêner comme chez les Jenner
À trente-deux piges, t'es pas 'sé-po'
T'as peur de prendre une Parigo
Deux gosses plus tard, tout à coup, elle t'apprend qu'c'est une prostituée d'Pizza Pino
Ils veulent m'épier, m'piller, voire me déshabiller, m'scier
Car ils pensent que les billets de la NBA
Posés chez 'oi-m' côté cheminée... ah, comme quoi faut s'méfier
T'y es pas du tout, c'est mon putain d'métier
Veuillez reculer, vous recroqueviller sur vous
Car vous n'êtes même pas conviés, je n'cesse d'enquiller, d'plier
Demande aux Antillais, je suis un mec trop entier
Puis ferme ta gueule pendant qu't'y es
Tu marches sur mon putain d'sentier
Tu pensais pouvoir t'en tirer, je vais t'attirer
T'enterrer, te tarteler, on t'a repéré, 93-12, Essonne, Tarterêts
Mon p'tit loup, mon p'tit loup, reste pas là, ça devient chelou
Mon p'tit loup, mon p'tit loup, éloigne-toi, y'a un loup-garou
Mon p'tit loup, mon p'tit loup, reste pas là, ça devient chelou1"

Quizá' algún día no te llore, -e, -e"
My Mom,Eminem,"Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay!
Alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo
Alright, I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now!

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner!
You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid!

My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on, 'cause—
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh!

Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it
But I don't need it — Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though!

Let It All Work Out,Lil Wayne,"Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch

Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
Don't let the money come between us
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, Let that shit work itself out
Let that shit work itself out
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, Tune, you knew me for way too long
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, Let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out (Yeah)
Let it all work out, let it all work out

Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, I'm sorry for even apologizing
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
Yeah, and he said
Let it all work out (Yeah)
Let it all work out
(I'm still in this bitch)
Let it all work out
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
Let it all work out
Let it all work out (Phew)
Let it all work out
(But he said, Remember this:)
Let it all work out
Let it all work out
(Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch)
Let it all work out (Yeah)
Let it all work out
(And don't forget what I did this, bitch)
Let it all work out
(Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch)
Let it all—
Let it all work out (Yeah)
Let it all work out
(Now I'm out this bitch)
Let it all work out
(I'm out this bitch)
Let it all—
(And it all worked out)

About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of
The optimist in me

But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half empty girl

BTS - Let Go (English Translation),Genius English Translations,"Before we say goodbye, let go
But I'm lost in the maze of my heart
From stereo to mono
That's how the path splits

If my fate is to disappear like this, then this is my last letter
Penned words, written then erased
Feelings for you, so many to let go
Unpuzzle my lego
At a level where it can't return to its original shape
So be it don't cry, I'mma let you go and fly

Hectic days, keeping myself busy
Distraction filled schedule
But I won't forget
Burned into the back of my mind like tattoo
We can't return to those days
If I could, I'd call your name
No, but I'll accept your blame
It really is time to say goodbye

Before we say goodbye, let go
But I'm lost in the maze of my heart
From stereo to mono
That's how the path splits, it continues
In order to release your hand right now
I gotta let you know (Gotta let you know)
That I need to let you go (Need to let you go)
Hard to say goodbye, but I can't run

I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)

What have you been up to lately?
Who are you thinking of so far away?
Life without you is really unbelievable
But even so I still gotta go
To the person I loved too much
To the red thread that got too entangled in itself
I couldn't reach you, so I'll walk a separate path
For that reason, I'll say goodbye

At first every day is like that
Beyond the tears hidden in the rain
I'll wait for you, let's start over
So that in the future
I can meet you again with a smile
In order to release your hand right now
I gotta let you know (Gotta let you know)
That I need to let you go (Need to let you go)
Hard to say goodbye, but I can' run

I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)

The color of the sky we saw together
The scent of the path we walked down together
Don't forget them

In order to release your hand right now (Ah)
I gotta let you know (Gotta let you know)
That I need to let you go (Need to let you go)
Hard to say goodbye, but I can't run

I'm ready to let go, oh (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)  yeah
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm ready to let go (Hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo)

Chaining Day,J. Cole,"Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, Here go your chain my nigga
This is chaining day
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)
They even iced out Jesus' hair

Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', Fake it 'til you make it
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)

Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery

I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time4"

Ahora ni siquiera yo puedo pensar
En otra cosa que no sea su caminar
Yeh, yeh, yeh"
​untitled 08 | 09.06.2014.,Kendrick Lamar,"Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (broke born babies)
Somebody yell Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said nigga you fucked up
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Pimp pimp (hooray!)3"
Time for That,Kevin Gates,"Yeah

Do you think I’ll ever need you, love, more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round still think I'm timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
I'm in a rush, it was nice to meet ya
Collared shirt, no elongated T's, cheaper to be yourself
Ain't no wrong way to be, accomplished a lot
I came from the block, ambitious in the trenches
I got a long way to reach
Sorry if I was offensive, but not at all
You got to pardon me at times, okay problem solved
When I hear the word can't take it like a challenge
I don't understand why the hell I can't have it
Help me understand why the hell I can't have it
I was blessed with a swag and I ain't braggin'
Insecurities get covered with designer fashion
If I'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
If you not feelin' what I'm sayin', sorry for the hassle
But if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic
Do you think I'll ever need you love more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Ain't no relaxin', they pillow fightin' on the sofa
Not at all my main focus though I was hopin'
Pull your hair, kiss it soft while you bendin' over
After that we could shower and I could hold ya
Havin' deep conversation and now you open
Pretendin' that I was asleep while you on the phone
Listen to you tell your girlfriend how I stroke it
Only that it was a foot I already know it, mind blowin'
Phone rang bout to go, is you rollin'
Playin' poker no cards, throwin' hands exposin'
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, slow motion
Kicked out of everywhere, expulsion
Do you think I'll ever need your love more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that.1"
OCD,Neil Hilborn,"The first time I saw her...
Everything in my head went quiet.
All the tics, all the constantly refreshing images just disappeared.
When you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, you don’t really get quiet moments.
Even in bed, I’m thinking:
Did I lock the doors? Yes.
Did I wash my hands? Yes.
Did I lock the doors? Yes.
Did I wash my hands? Yes.
But when I saw her, the only thing I could think about was the hairpin curve of her lips..
Or the eyelash on her cheek—
the eyelash on her cheek—
the eyelash on her cheek.
I knew I had to talk to her.
I asked her out six times in thirty seconds.
She said yes after the third one, but none of them felt right, so I had to keep going.
On our first date, I spent more time organizing my meal by color than I did eating it, or fucking talking to her...
But she loved it.
She loved that I had to kiss her goodbye sixteen times or twenty-four times if it was Wednesday.
She loved that it took me forever to walk home because there are lots of cracks on our sidewalk.
When we moved in together, she said she felt safe, like no one would ever rob us because I definitely locked the door eighteen times.
I’d always watch her mouth when she talked—
when she talked—
when she talked—
when she talked
when she talked;
when she said she loved me, her mouth would curl up at the edges.
At night, she’d lay in bed and watch me turn all the lights off.. And on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off, and on, and off.
She’d close her eyes and imagine that the days and nights were passing in front of her.
Some mornings I’d start kissing her goodbye but she’d just leave cause I was
just making her late for work...
When I stopped in front of a crack in the sidewalk, she just kept walking...
When she said she loved me her mouth was a straight line.
She told me that I was taking up too much of her time.
Last week she started sleeping at her mother’s place.
She told me that she shouldn’t have let me get so attached to her; that this whole thing was a mistake, but...
How can it be a mistake that I don’t have to wash my hands after I touched her?
Love is not a mistake, and it’s killing me that she can run away from this and I just can’t.
I can’t – I can’t go out and find someone new because I always think of her.
Usually, when I obsess over things, I see germs sneaking into my skin.
I see myself crushed by an endless succession of cars...
And she was the first beautiful thing I ever got stuck on.
I want to wake up every morning thinking about the way she holds her steering wheel..
How she turns shower knobs like she's opening a safe.
How she blows out candles—
blows out candles—
blows out candles—
blows out candles—
blows out candles—
blows out…
Now, I just think about who else is kissing her.
I can’t breathe because he only kisses her once — he doesn’t care if it’s perfect!
I want her back so bad...
I leave the door unlocked.
I leave the lights on.18"
Black or White,Michael Jackson,"Hey!
What?
Turn that off!
Dad, this is the best part!
Turn it off!
No!
It’s too late for this, turn it off!
Dad, this is the best part, come on!
No, turn it off now!
No, this is the, I want to listen to it, okay?
You’ve got things to do tomorrow
Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this

Aaow!
Aaow!

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah)3"
Heat,Eminem,"Wanna take it from the top?

Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: I gotta meet her like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (Word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
Ain't steppin' to you, bitch, I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
Letter come to me—mail. Sweater, heat, some degree.  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said—
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (Duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl
Your body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!7"
Sober Up,AJR,"Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missin' me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I wanna feel somethin' again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh oh oh oh)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?

Goodbye, goodbye
I said to my best-est buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I want to feel somethin' again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh oh oh oh)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?

How's it go again? (Go again, go again, go again…)

My favorite color is you
You're vibratin' out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
My favorite color is you
You're vibratin' out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be

Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missin' me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young
And I want to feel somethin' again
I just wanna feel somethin' again
How's it go again?

Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I want to feel somethin' again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again? (My favorite color is you)
Can I finally feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?3"
Uptown,Drake,"Yeah
Uh-huh

Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, Drake is just a younger you
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

Stepdad,Eminem,"Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, Oops and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, Fuck you, punk and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
Ding-dong, the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)6"
Crazy Story 2.0,King Von,"And I'ma let that MAC fly just like my nigga Durk (Bow)
I'ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I'ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on (Von), alright (Von)

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shits, she told me where he be
I say for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like Von, you already know, just put put your girl on fleek
I'm like Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want some shoes?
Jimmy Choo, with a handbag too, red or baby blue?
She get to smiling, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughing, could've been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speeding, could've been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, could've been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it's like six, told her hit his phone
Meet her in The Wic, but he ain't go
But he ain't that slow, said meet him at the store
I'm like cool, let him front his move, do what he gon' do
'Cause this the plot, put him in a pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot, but that's just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6 to 24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pulling up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fork
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
The block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happened:
I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lackin', 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out What's crackin?
I'm like, What?, I'm like, Nigga, who?, I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang, when it comes to chains
So I ride, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh
This no lie, bitch it's do or die, you say you gon' slide?
You got some nerve, yo' shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd
I got a drop on a rappin' nigga, I be from the 'Raq
I'm like, cool, better not front yo' move, or you become a pack
You see Von, you see 40 Glocks, see Booka, you see MAC
Yeah free Mak, gone for a double homi', foenem got yo back
But fuck that, say you smoking who? Quickest way to die
Snatch who chain? Off who neck? Not mine
Ain't no point in trying
They not out, plus the police hot, ain't no point in sliding
They be talking from the internet, they don't be outside
Hit the six, call DaDa out, tell him 'bout a lick
We need tape, we need rope and phones, don't forget the blicks
He like, Cool, how that nigga look? I pull up some flicks
He like, Damn I think I know the nigga He cool with his bitch
We at V-Live, but we went to Structure, but we played a lot
Got a goofy walking in and out, telling me his car
He in a Cat, bet, I'ma pay you half, just finesse
I'm 300, clips don't come like that, three drums to his chest
Boom, boom, boom (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Bitch, we lurking 63rd (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Bitch, we lurking 63rd (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Stretch gang, put in work (Ayy, ayy, ayy)"

Ooh (Hehehe, hehe)

Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (Sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah
Um, well

Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, All you ever think about is sex
I'm like, Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

All she wanted was a little gravy train for Christmas
She was purely interested in giving me the business

Pretty sure I was like twenty when it happened (Flex)
Speakers playing Marvin Gaye, so I started snapping
All of a sudden mama had her ass clapping
We were in the aisle with the paper and the napkins (Ooh)
I was mesmerized by the way that it was shaking
Looked down at her cart and all she had was bacon (Oh)
Oh shit, I think she want some breakfast

I'm not trying to pull up on your wife, girl, I promise
But it's starting to look a lot like Trapped in the Closet (Oh)
I was thinking about that masterpiece by R. Kelly
When suddenly my dentist started rubbing on my belly (Oh)
Looked down at her cart, she had the biscuits with the jelly
That's the time that Gravy hit a threesome in the deli (Huh)
Gravy got racks, and my baby got back
(Gang, gang, gang)
Serenade your bitch on the sax (Huh)
No slack in my mack, y'all better relax

R. Kelly playing while I lay that pipe

Sweet,Cigarettes After Sex,"Watching the video that you sent me
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

Of Mice and Men: Chapter 4,John Steinbeck,"FOUR
Crooks, the Negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a  little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn. On one side of the  little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks' bunk was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended; strips of new leather; and under the window itself  a little bench for leather-working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riveter. On pegs were also  pieces of harness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering split.
Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back.
Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a big alarm clock and a single-barreled shotgun. And he had books, too; a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil code for 1905. There were battered magazines and a few dirty books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold-rimmed spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed. This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks was a proud, aloof man. He kept his distance and demanded that other people keep theirs. His body was bent over to the left by his crooked spine, and his eyes lay deep in his head, and because of their depth seemed to glitter with intensity. His lean face was lined with deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain-tightened lips which were lighter than his face.
It was Saturday night. Through the open door that led into the barn came the sound of moving horses, of feet stirring, of teeth champing on hay, of the rattle of halter chains. In the stable buck's room a small electric globe threw a meager yellow light. Crooks sat on his bunk. His shirt was out of his jeans in back. In one hand he held a bottle of liniment, and with the other he rubbed his spine. Now and then he poured a few drops of the liniment into his pink-palmed hand and reached up under his shirt to rub again. He flexed his muscles against his back and shivered.
Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking in, his big shoulders nearly filling the opening. For a moment Crooks did not see him, but on raising his eyes he stiffened and a scowl came on his face. His hand came out from under his shirt. Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends.
Crooks said sharply, You got no right to come in my room. This here's my room. Nobody got any right in here but me.
Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. I ain't doing nothing, he said. Just come to look at my puppy. And I seen your light, he explained.
Well, I got a right to have a light. You go on get outa my room. I ain't wanted in the bunkhouse, and you ain't wanted in my room.
Why ain't you wanted? Lennie asked.
'Cause I'm black. They play cards in there, but I can't play because I'm black. They say I stink. Well, I tell you, you all of you stink to me.
Lennie flapped his big hands helplessly. Ever'body went into town, he said. Slim an' George an' ever'body. George says I gotta stay here an' not get in no trouble. I seen your light.
Well, what do you want?
Nothing- I seen your light. I thought I could jus' come in an' set.
Crooks stared at Lennie, and he reached behind him and took down the spectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and stared again. I don't know what you're doin' in the barn anyway, he complained.
You ain't no skinner. They's no call for a bucker to come into the barn at all. You ain't no skinner. You ain't got nothing to do with the horses.
The pup, Lennie repeated. I come to see my pup.
Well, go see your pup, then. Don't come in a place where you're not wanted.
Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into the room, then remembered and backed to the door again.
I looked at 'em a little. Slim says I ain't to pet 'em very much.
Crooks said, Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the time. I wonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else.
Oh, she don't care. She lets me. Lennie had moved into the room again. Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him.
Come on in and set a while, Crooks said. 'Long as you won't get out and leave me alone, you might as well set down. His tone was a little more friendly. All the boys gone into town, huh?
All but old Candy. He just sets in the bunkhouse sharpening his pencil and sharpening and figuring.
Crooks adjusted his glasses. Figuring? What's Candy figuring about?
Lennie almost shouted, 'Bout the rabbits.
You're nuts, said Crooks. You're crazy as a wedge. What rabbits you talkin' about?
The rabbits we're gonna get, and I get to tend 'em, cut grass an' give 'em water, an' like that.
Jus' nuts, said Crooks. I don't blame the guy you travel with for keepin' you outa sight.
Lennie said quietly, It ain't no lie. We're gonna do it. Gonna get a little place an' live on the fatta the lan'.
Crooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk. Set down, he invited. Set down on the nail keg.
Lennie hunched down on the little barrel. You think it's a lie, Lennie said. But it ain't no lie. Ever' word's the truth, an' you can ast George.
Crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. You travel aroun' with George, don't ya?
Sure. Me an' him goes ever' place together.
Crooks continued. Sometimes he talks, and you don't know what the hell he's talkin' about. Ain't that so? He leaned forward, boring Lennie with his deep eyes. Ain't that so?
Yeah... sometimes.
Jus' talks on, an' you don't know what the hell it's all about?
Yeah... sometimes. But... not always.
Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk. I ain't a southern Negro, he said. I was born right here in California. My old man had a chicken ranch, 'bout ten acres. The white kids come to play at our place, an' sometimes I went to play with them, and some of them was pretty nice. My ol' man didn't like that. I never knew till long later why he didn't like that. But I know now.
He hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. There wasn't another colored family for miles around. And now there ain't a colored man on this ranch an' there's jus' one family in Soledad. He laughed. If I say something, why it's just a nigger sayin' it.
Lennie asked, How long you think it'll be before them pups will be old enough to pet?
Crooks laughed again. A guy can talk to you an' be sure you won't go blabbin'. Couple of weeks an' them pups'll be all right. George knows what he's about. Jus' talks, an' you don't understand nothing. He leaned forward excitedly.
This is just a nigger talkin', an' a busted-back nigger. So it don't mean nothing, see? You couldn't remember it anyways. I seen it over an' over- a guy talkin' to another guy and it don't make no difference if he don't hear or understand. The thing is, they're talkin', or they're settin' still not talkin'. It don't make no difference, no difference.
His excitement had increased until he pounded his knee with this hand.
George can tell you screwy things, and it don't matter. It's just the talking. It's just bein' with another guy. That's all. He paused. His voice grew soft and persuasive. S'pose George don't come back no more. S'pose he took a powder and just ain't coming back. What'll you do then?
Lennie's attention came gradually to what had been said. What? he demanded.
I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard of him no more. Crooks pressed forward some kind of private victory. Just s'pose that, he repeated.
He won't do it, Lennie cried. George wouldn't do nothing like that. I been with George a long a time. He'll come back tonight- But the doubt was too much for him. Don't you think he will?
Crooks' face lighted with pleasure in his torture. Nobody can't tell what a guy'll do, he observed calmly. Le's say he wants to come back and can't. S'pose he gets killed or hurt so he can't come back.
Lennie struggled to understand. George won't do nothing like that, he repeated. George is careful. He won't get hurt. He ain't never been hurt, 'cause he's careful.
Well, s'pose, jus' s'pose he don't come back. What'll you do then? Lennie's face wrinkled with apprehension. I don' know. Say, what you doin' anyways? he cried. This ain't true. George ain't got hurt.
Crooks bored in on him. Want me ta tell ya what'll happen? They'll take ya to the booby hatch. They'll tie ya up with a collar, like a dog.
Suddenly Lennie's eyes centered and grew quiet, and mad. He stood up and walked dangerously toward Crooks. Who hurt George? he demanded.
Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on his bunk to get out of the way. I was just supposin', he said. George ain't hurt. He's all right. He'll be back all right.
Lennie stood over him. What you supposin' for? Ain't nobody goin' to suppose no hurt to George.
Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers.
Jus' set down, he said. George ain't hurt.
Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg. Ain't nobody goin' to talk no hurt to George, he grumbled.
Crooks said gently, Maybe you can see now. You got George. You know he's goin' to come back. S'pose you didn't have nobody. S'pose you couldn't go into the bunkhouse and play rummy 'cause you was black. How'd you like that? S'pose you had to sit out here an' read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain't no good. A guy needs somebody- to be near him. He whined, A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. Don't make no difference who the guy is, long's he's with you. I tell ya, he cried, I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an' he gets sick.
George gonna come back, Lennie reassured himself in a frightened voice. Maybe George come back already. Maybe I better go see.
Crooks said, I didn't mean to scare you. He'll come back. I was talkin' about myself. A guy sets alone out here at night, maybe readin' books or thinkin' or stuff like that. Sometimes he gets thinkin', an' he got nothing to tell him what's so an' what ain't so. Maybe if he sees somethin', he don't know whether it's right or not. He can't turn to some other guy and ast him if he sees it too. He can't tell. He got nothing to measure by. I seen things out here. I wasn't drunk. I don't know if I was asleep. If some guy was with me, he could tell me I was asleep, an' then it would be all right. But I jus' don't know. Crooks was looking across the room now, looking toward the window.
Lennie said miserably, George wun't go away and leave me. I know George wun't do that.
The stable buck went on dreamily, I remember when I was a little kid on my old man's chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They was always near me, always there. Used to sleep right in the same room, right in the same bed- all three. Had a strawberry patch. Had an alfalfa patch. Used to turn the chickens out in the alfalfa on a sunny morning. My brothers'd set on a fence rail an' watch 'em- white chickens they was.
Gradually Lennie's interest came around to what was being said. George says we're gonna have alfalfa for the rabbits.
What rabbits?
We're gonna have rabbits an' a berry patch.
You're nuts.
We are too. You ast George.
You're nuts. Crooks was scornful. I seen hunderds of men come by on the road an' on the ranches, with their bindles on their back an' that same damn thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They come, an' they quit an' go on; an' every damn one of 'em's got a little piece of land in his head. An' never a God damn one of 'em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever'body wants a little piece of lan'. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody gets no land. It's just in their head. They're all the time talkin' about it, but it's jus' in their head.
He paused and looked toward the open door, for the horses were moving restlessly and the halter chains clinked. A horse whinnied. I guess somebody's out there, Crooks said. Maybe Slim. Slim comes in sometimes two, three times a night. Slim's a real skinner. He looks out for his team. He pulled himself painfully upright and moved toward the door.
That you, Slim? he called.
Candy's voice answered. Slim went in town. Say, you seen Lennie?
Ya mean the big guy?
Yeah. Seen him around any place?
He's in here, Crooks said shortly. He went back to his bunk and lay down.
Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald wrist and looking blindly into the lighted room. He made no attempt to enter. Tell ya what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them rabbits.
Crooks said irritably, You can come in if you want.
Candy seemed embarrassed. I do' know. 'Course, if ya want me to.
Come on in. If ever'body's comin' in, you might just as well. It was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger.
Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed, You got a nice cozy little place in here, he said to Crooks. Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way.
Sure, said Crooks. And a manure pile under the window. Sure, it's swell.
Lennie broke in, You said about them rabbits.
Candy leaned against the wall beside the broken collar while he scratched the wrist stump. I been here a long time, he said. An' Crooks been here a long time. This's the first time I ever been in his room.
Crooks said darkly, Guys don't come into a colored man's room very much. Nobody been here but Slim. Slim an' the boss.
Candy quickly changed the subject. Slim's as good a skinner as I ever seen.
Lennie leaned toward the old swamper. About them rabbits, he insisted.
Candy smiled. I got it figured out. We can make some money on them rabbits if we go about it right.
But I get to tend 'em, Lennie broke in. George says I get to tend 'em. He promised.
Crooks interrupted brutally. You guys is just kiddin' yourself. You'll talk about it a hell of a lot, but you won't get no land. You'll be a swamper here till they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too many guys. Lennie here'll quit an' be on the road in two, three weeks. Seems like ever' guy got land in his head.
Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. You God damn right we're gonna do it. George says we are. We got the money right now.
Yeah? said Crooks. An' where's George now? In town in a whore house. That's where your money's goin'. Jesus, I seen it happen too many times. I seen too many guys with land in their head. They never get none under their hand.
Candy cried, Sure they all want it. Everybody wants a little bit of land, not much. Jus' som'thin' that was his. Som'thin' he could live on and there couldn't nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. I planted crops for damn near ever'body in this state, but they wasn't my crops, and when I harvested 'em, it wasn't none of my harvest. But we gonna do it now, and don't you make no mistake about that. George ain't got the money in town. That money's in the bank. Me an' Lennie an' George. We gonna have a room to ourself. We're gonna have a dog an' rabbits an' chickens. We're gonna have green corn an' maybe a cow or a goat. He stopped, overwhelmed with his picture. Crooks asked, You say you got the money?
Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little bit more to get. Have it all in one month. George got the land all picked out, too.
Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand. I never seen a guy really do it, he said. I seen guys nearly crazy with loneliness for land, but ever' time a whore house or a blackjack game took what it takes. He hesitated. ...If you... guys would want a hand to work for nothing- just his keep, why I'd come an' lend a hand. I ain't so crippled I can't work like a son-of-a-bitch if I want to.
Any you boys seen Curley?
They swung their heads toward the door. Looking in was Curley's wife. Her face was heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. She breathed strongly, as though she had been running.
Curley ain't been here, Candy said sourly.
She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at them, rubbing the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other. And her eyes traveled from one face to another.
They left all the weak ones here, she said finally. Think I don't know where they all went? Even Curley. I know where they all went.
Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and Crooks were scowling down away from her eyes. Candy said, Then if you know, why you want to ast us where Curley is at?
She regarded them amusedly. Funny thing, she said. If I catch any one man, and he's alone, I get along fine with him. But just let two of the guys get together an' you won't talk. Jus' nothing but mad.
She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips. You're all scared of each other, that's what. Ever' one of you's scared the rest is goin' to get something on you.
After a pause Crooks said, Maybe you better go along to your own house now. We don't want no trouble.
Well, I ain't giving you no trouble. Think I don't like to talk to somebody ever' once in a while? Think I like to stick in that house alla time?
Candy laid the stump of his wrist on his knee and rubbed it gently with his hand. He said accusingly, You gotta husban'. You got no call foolin' aroun' with other guys, causin' trouble.
The girl flared up. Sure I gotta husban'. You all seen him. Swell guy, ain't he? Spends all his time sayin' what he's gonna do to guys he don't like, and he don't like nobody. Think I'm gonna stay in that two-by-four house and listen how Curley's gonna lead with his left twicet, and then bring in the ol' right cross? 'One-two,' he says. 'Jus' the ol' one-two an' he'll go down.' She paused and her face lost its sullenness and grew interested.
Say- what happened to Curley's han'?
There was an embarrassed silence. Candy stole a look at Lennie. Then he coughed. Why... Curley... he got his han' caught in a machine, ma'am. Bust his han'.
She watched for a moment, and then she laughed. Baloney! What you think you're sellin' me? Curley started som'pin' he didn' finish. Caught in a machine- baloney! Why, he ain't give nobody the good ol' one-two since he got his han' bust. Who bust him?
Candy repeated sullenly, Got it caught in a machine.
Awright, she said contemptuously. Awright, cover 'im up if ya wanta. Whatta I care? You bindle bums think you're so damn good. Whatta ya think I am, a kid? I tell ya I could of went with shows. Not jus' one, neither. An' a guy tol' me he could put me in pitchers.... She was breathless with indignation.
-Sat'iday night. Ever'body out doin' som'pin'. Ever'body! An' what am I doin'? Standin' here talkin' to a bunch of bindle stiffs- a nigger an' a dum-dum and a lousy ol' sheep- an' likin' it because they ain't nobody else.
Lennie watched her, his mouth half open. Crooks had retired into the terrible protective dignity of the Negro. But a change came over old Candy. He stood up suddenly and knocked his nail keg over backward.
I had enough, he said angrily. You ain't wanted here. We told you you ain't. An' I tell ya, you got floozy idears about what us guys amounts to. You ain't got sense enough in that chicken head to even see that we ain't stiffs. S'pose you get us canned. S'pose you do. You think we'll hit the highway an' look for another lousy two-bit job like this. You don't know that we got our own ranch to go to, an' our own house. We ain't got to stay here. We gotta house and chickens an' fruit trees an' a place a hunderd time prettier than this. An' we got fren's, that's what we got. Maybe there was a time when we was scared of gettin' canned, but we ain't no more. We got our own lan', and it's ours, an' we c'n go to it.
Curley's wife laughed at him. Baloney, she said. I seen too many you guys. If you had two bits in the worl', why you'd be in gettin' two shots of corn with it and suckin' the bottom of the glass. I know you guys.
Candy's face had grown redder and redder, but before she was done speaking, he had control of himself. He was the master of the situation.
I might of knew, he said gently. Maybe you just better go along an' roll your hoop. We ain't got nothing to say to you at all. We know what we got, and we don't care whether you know it or not. So maybe you better jus' scatter along now, 'cause Curley maybe ain't gonna like his wife out in the barn with us 'bindle stiffs.'
She looked from one face to another, and they were all closed against her. And she looked longest at Lennie, until he dropped his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly she said, Where'd you get them bruises on your face?
Lennie looked up guiltily. Who- me?
Yeah, you.
Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he looked at his lap again.
He got his han' caught in a machine, he said.
Curley's wife laughed. O.K., Machine. I'll talk to you later. I like machines.
Candy broke in. You let this guy alone. Don't you do no messing aroun' with him. I'm gonna tell George what you says. George won't have you messin' with Lennie.
Who's George? she asked. The little guy you come with?
Lennie smiled happily. That's him, he said. That's the guy, an' he's gonna let me tend the rabbits.
Well, if that's all you want, I might get a couple rabbits myself.
Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. I had enough, he said coldly. You got no rights comin' in a colored man's room. You got no rights messing around in here at all. Now you jus' get out, an' get out quick. If you don't, I'm gonna ast the boss not to ever let you come in the barn no more.
She turned on him in scorn. Listen, Nigger, she said. You know what I can do to you if you open your trap?
Crooks stared hopelessly at her, and then he sat down on his bunk and drew into himself.
She closed on him. You know what I could do?
Crooks seemed to grow smaller, and he pressed himself against the wall. Yes, ma'am.
Well, you keep your place then, Nigger. I could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain't even funny.
Crooks had reduced himself to nothing. There was no personality, no ego- nothing to arouse either like or dislike. He said, Yes, ma'am, and his voice was toneless.
For a moment she stood over him as though waiting for him to move so that she could whip at him again; but Crooks sat perfectly still, his eyes averted, everything that might be hurt drawn in. She turned at last to the other two.
Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. If you was to do that, we'd tell, he said quietly. We'd tell about you framin' Crooks.
Tell an' be damned, she cried. Nobody'd listen to you, an' you know it. Nobody'd listen to you.
Candy subsided. No.... he agreed. Nobody'd listen to us.
Lennie whined, I wisht George was here. I wisht George was here. Candy stepped over to him. Don't you worry none, he said. I jus' heard the guys comin' in. George'll be in the bunkhouse right now, I bet.
He turned to Curley's wife. You better go home now, he said quietly. If you go right now, we won't tell Curley you was here.
She appraised him coolly. I ain't sure you heard nothing.
Better not take no chances, he said. If you ain't sure, you better take the safe way.
She turned to Lennie. I'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit. He got it comin' to him. Sometimes I'd like to bust him myself.
She slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn. And while she went through the barn, the halter chains rattled, and some horses snorted and some stamped their feet.
Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the layers of protection he had put on. Was that the truth what you said about the guys come back? he asked.
Sure. I heard 'em.
Well, I didn't hear nothing.
The gate banged, Candy said, and he went on, Jesus Christ, Curley's wife can move quiet. I guess she had a lot of practice, though.
Crooks avoided the whole subject now. Maybe you guys better go, he said. I ain't sure I want you in here no more. A colored man got to have some rights even if he don't like 'em.
Candy said, That bitch didn't ought to of said that to you.
It wasn't nothing, Crooks said dully. You guys comin' in an' settin' made me forget. What she says is true.
The horses snorted out in the barn and the chains rang and a voice called, Lennie. Oh, Lennie. You in the barn?
It's George, Lennie cried. And he answered, Here, George. I'm right in here.
In a second George stood framed in the door, and he looked
disapprovingly about. What you doin' in Crooks' room? You hadn't ought to be here.
Crooks nodded. I tol' 'em, but they come in anyways.
Well, why'n't you kick 'em out?
I di'n't care much, said Crooks. Lennie's a nice fella.
Now Candy aroused himself. Oh, George! I been figurin' and figurin'. I got it doped out how we can even make some money on them rabbits.
George scowled. I thought I tol' you not to tell nobody about that.
Candy was crestfallen. Didn't tell nobody but Crooks.
George said, Well you guys get outa here. Jesus, seems like I can't go away for a minute.
Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the door. Crooks called,
Candy!
Huh?
'Member what I said about hoein' and doin' odd jobs?
Yeah, said Candy. I remember.
Well, jus' forget it, said Crooks. I didn't mean it. Jus' foolin'. I wouldn' want to go no place like that.
Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good night.
The three men went out of the door. As they went through the barn the horses snorted and the halter chains rattled. Crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the door for a moment, and then he reached for the liniment bottle. He pulled out his shirt in back, poured a little liniment in his pink palm and, reaching around, he fell slowly to rubbing his back.2"
Untitled 2 (Blue Faces),Kendrick Lamar,"Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience, and you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it
See, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success
Corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!

Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down

My homegirl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a Black woman wishin'
She saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasin' education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today, I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces (Faces)
I hit the bank today and tell 'em, color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down, to the top

I love God, I love speed
I love drank, I love mead
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
Ugh! But I’m scared of godspeeeeeeed
Sometimes

I wrote this song
Looking at a broke home, maybe (Broke home, maybe)
You know the poverty-stricken
The little broke boy and babies (Broke boy and babies)
Somebody say Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy
And I said “Why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
And said Homie, you're messed up
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
Never been through 'ish, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
YSay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t it, I live in a hut
You're living to keep warm, I'm living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
Bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
These days ain’t no compromise, ugh
Your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See, I made my moves with shackled feet
Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Caaaaaaaaape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Ugh!

TEMPTATION,Joey Bada$$,"I come here today to talk about how I feel
And I feel like that we are treated differently than other people
And I don't like how we’re treated
Just because of our color doesn't mean anything to me

This just the way I feel
Mind's been racing so long, yeah
It’s just no way to deal
With these problems alone

And I really can't take it no more
I've been fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm young and I'm restless
(And I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?
(I said Lord, can you help me?)

Now everybody got problems, yeah
But wouldn't know what way to solve ’em
I really came up from the bottom
Strugglin’, my momma on her last dollar
Hustlin' and I’ve been puttin' in these hours
The government been tryna take away what's ours
It's really all about the money and the power
I just wanna see my people empowered
Uh, uh, tell me how we gon’ shape this vision
Complainin' all day, but in the same condition
If you wanna make change, it's gon' take commitment
Some people enslaved by they religion
Can't emancipate them from the mental prisons
What I seen through optics transform to wisdom
Watch me use my prophets, get 'em all to listen
I've been on a mission, ah

Until they leave 'em lifeless

Lord knows we just tryna live righteous
Are you willin' just to make the sacrifices?
I know we can't continue livin' like this
And I'll never sell my soul 'cause that's priceless, uh, uh
Tell me how we gon' make a livin'
Hustle on the block, who gon' save the children?
Man it's all a plot and I'm just revealin'
The media just tryna make a villain
I just take the pain and a paint a picture
Voices in my head, I hear the whispers
When I feel this way, inhale the swisher

Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully

Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ - let me guess: that’s your mannequin?

Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'

I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering

Open my third eye (Ayy)
That's my baby, she woke (Ooh)

When I'm with her, we grow (We go)
I found my light
In the way that she glow (Ooh, yeah)

Purple light, like a beam (See what that purple like)
I dream in indigo

Am I wrong for showing interest in these women surrounding
I'ma straight dick her down and go
No time to lounge with hoes
On the grind, all the time
I done been down this road
Strictly need my C-notes, can you keep up with my lingo?
Some'll say life is a gamble, which means love is a casino
Everybody just playin' to win, think I made it again
Though many ladies pretend, hoping this ain't what it is
This business I'm in, may make me taking a bid
Would you still be my friend, when I'm lonely, love?
Get 'em gone, cause ain't no one on the phone, but us
Someone who strong when it's rough, someone who won't give up

Motion for me, girl
Arch up to the ceiling, now bend over for me, girl
Pulling on your hair, while I'm gripping on your ass
When I kill it from the back, know you feel it in your back
Late night screaming, all of the right reasons
Touching, teasing, blowing it might please
Make it bite back, I love when it bite me
Saying take some out, I know what it might be
When your body go to shaking, you're raising your right knee
Bit the pillow with your teeth, I know what it might mean
I'ma keep going, I know that the light green
Can't stay still, I'm stroking the right thing
Climb in the bed, with a dime in the bed
Don't tell me the spot, I'ma find it instead
Big, fine muthafucka, she a dime with the head
Just got a text, never mind what it said
​iPhone ringing, I decline with a fret

Decline or accept, next line never read
Minus the time and the time been the best
Told her what it was first time that we met

The Great Gatsby (Chapter VIII),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.
Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.
“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.”
His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.
“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.”
“Go away NOW, old sport?”
“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”
He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.
It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.
She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him — he had never been in such a beautiful house before, but what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there — it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms up-stairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy — it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.
But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously — eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.
He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself — that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities — he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.
But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go — but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby — nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.
When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.
“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was, ‘way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?” On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.
He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.
For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the BEALE STREET BLUES, while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.
Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.
That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.
It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows down-stairs, filling the house with gray-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.
“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”
He sat down gloomily.
“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”
Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.
“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”
What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?
He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.
He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.
The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.
It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.
“I’m going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”
“Don’t do it to-day,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. “You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”
I looked at my watch and stood up.
“Twelve minutes to my train.”
I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.
“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.
“Do, old sport.”
“I’ll call you about noon.”
We walked slowly down the steps.
“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.
“I suppose so.”
“Well, good-by.”
We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.
“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”
I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them good-by.
I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that—I and the others.
“Good-by,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”
Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.
“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.”
Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.
“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”
“How could it have mattered then?”
Silence for a moment. Then:
“However—I want to see you.”
“I want to see you, too.”
“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?”
“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”
“Very well.”
“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various——”
We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking any longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world.
I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my time-table, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.
When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.
They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Some one, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.
Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and every one who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.
About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.
But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.
“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?”
“Twelve years.”
“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”
The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.
“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”
“Don’t belong to any.”
“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”
“That was a long time ago.”
The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.
“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.
“Which drawer?”
“That drawer—that one.”
Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.
“This?” he inquired, holding it up.
Wilson stared and nodded.
“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”
“You mean your wife bought it?”
“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”
Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.
“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.
“Who did?”
“I have a way of finding out.”
“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”
“He murdered her.”
“It was an accident, George.”
Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”
“I know,” he said definitely, “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”
Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.
“How could she of been like that?”
“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h——”
He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.
“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”
This was a forlorn hope — he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.
Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small gray clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.
“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window.”— with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it ——” and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’”
Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.
“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.
“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.
By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.
His movements — he was on foot all the time — were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time — there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.
At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances — and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.
Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.
No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock — until long after there was any one to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about... like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.
The chauffeur — he was one of Wolfsheim’s proteges — heard the shots — afterward he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I, hurried down to the pool.
There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other with little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water.
It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.1"

Lord of the Flies (Chap. 1: The Sound of the Shell),William Golding,"CHAPTER ONE: The Sound of the Shell
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.
Hi! it said. Wait a minute!
The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.
Wait a minute, the voice said. I got caught up.
The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.
The voice spoke again.
I can't hardly move with all these creeper things.
The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.
Where's the man with the megaphone?
The fair boy shook his head.
This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere.
The fat boy looked startled.
There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.
The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.
All them other kids, the fat boy went on. Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?
The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.
Aren't there any grownups at all?
I don't think so.
The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.
No grownups!
The fat boy thought for a moment.
That pilot.
The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth.
He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn't land here. Not in a place with wheels.
We was attacked!
He'll be back all right.
The fat boy shook his head.
When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.
He looked up and down the scar.
And this is what the cabin done.
The fair boy reached out and touched the jagged end of a trunk. For a moment he looked interested.
What happened to it? he asked. Where's it got to now?
That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn't half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling. There must have been some kids still in it.
He hesitated for a moment, then spoke again.
What's your name?
Ralph.
The fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this proffer of acquaintance was not made; the fair boy called Ralph smiled vaguely, stood up, and began to make his way once more toward the lagoon. The fat boy hung steadily at his shoulder.
I expect there's a lot more of us scattered about. You haven't seen any others, have you?
Ralph shook his head and increased his speed. Then he tripped over a branch and came down with a crash.
The fat boy stood by him, breathing hard.
My auntie told me not to run, he explained, on account of my asthma.
Ass-mar?
That's right. Can't catch my breath. I was the only boy in our school what had asthma, said the fat boy with a touch of pride. And I've been wearing specs since I was three.
He took off his glasses and held them out to Ralph, blinking and smiling, and then started to wipe them against his grubby wind-breaker. An expression of pain and inward concentration altered the pale contours of his face. He smeared the sweat from his cheeks and quickly adjusted the spectacles on his nose.
Them fruit.
He glanced round the scar.
Them fruit, he said, I expect--
He put on his glasses, waded away from Ralph, and crouched down among the tangled foliage.
I'll be out again in just a minute--
Ralph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the branches. In a few seconds the fat boy's grunts were behind him and he was hurrying toward the screen that still lay between him and the lagoon. He climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle.
The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar. Ralph stood, one hand against a grey trunk, and screwed up his eyes against the shimmering water. Out there, perhaps a mile away, the white surf flinked on a coral reef, and beyond that the open sea was dark blue. Within the irregular arc of coral the lagoon was still as a mountain lake--blue of all shades and shadowy green and purple. The beach between the palm terrace and the water was a thin stick, endless apparently, for to Ralph's left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew to a point at infinity; and always, almost visible, was the heat.
He jumped down from the terrace. The sand was thick over his black shoes and the heat hit him. He became conscious of the weight of clothes, kicked his shoes off fiercely and ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement. Then he leapt back on the terrace, pulled off his shirt, and stood there among the skull-like coconuts with green shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin. He undid the snake-clasp of his belt, lugged off his shorts and pants, and stood there naked, looking at the dazzling beach and the water.
He was old enough, twelve years and a few months, to have lost the prominent tummy of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward. You could see now that he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went, but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil. He patted the palm trunk softly, and, forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and stood on his head. He turned neatly on to his feet, jumped down to the beach, knelt and swept a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest. Then he sat back and looked at the water with bright, excited eyes.
Ralph--
The fat boy lowered himself over the terrace and sat down carefully, using the edge as a seat.
I'm sorry I been such a time. Them fruit--
He wiped his glasses and adjusted them on his button nose. The frame had made a deep, pink V on the bridge. He looked critically at Ralph's golden body and then down at his own clothes. He laid a hand on the end of a zipper that extended down his chest.
My auntie--
Then he opened the zipper with decision and pulled the whole wind-breaker over his head.
There!
Ralph looked at him sidelong and said nothing.
I expect we'll want to know all their names, said the fat boy, and make a list. We ought to have a meeting.
Ralph did not take the hint so the fat boy was forced to continue.
I don't care what they call me, he said confidentially, so long as they don't call me what they used to call me at school.
Ralph was faintly interested.
What was that?
The fat boy glanced over his shoulder, then leaned toward Ralph. He whispered.
They used to call me 'Piggy.'
Ralph shrieked with laughter. He jumped up.
Piggy! Piggy!
Ralph--please!
Piggy clasped his hands in apprehension.
I said I didn't want--
Piggy! Piggy!
Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.
Sche-aa-ow!
He dived in the sand at Piggy's feet and lay there laughing.
Piggy!
Piggy grinned reluctantly, pleased despite himself at even this much recognition.
So long as you don't tell the others--
Ralph giggled into the sand. The expression of pain and concentration returned to Piggy's face.
Half a sec'.
He hastened back into the forest. Ralph stood up and trotted along to the right.
Here the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape; a great platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high. The top of this was covered with a thin layer of soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees. There was not enough soil for them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried, forming a criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit on. The palms that still stood made a green roof, covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon. Ralph hauled himself onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided that the shadows on his body were really green. He picked his way to the seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water. It was clear to the bottom and bright with the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral. A school of tiny, glittering fish flicked hither and thither. Ralph spoke to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight.
Whizzoh!
Beyond the platform there was more enchantment. Some act of God--a typhoon perhaps, or the storm that had accompanied his own arrival--had banked sand inside the lagoon so that there was a long, deep pool in the beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the further end. Ralph had been deceived before now by the specious appearance of depth in a beach pool and he approached this one preparing to be disappointed. But the island ran true to form and the incredible pool, which clearly was only invaded by the sea at high tide, was so deep at one end as to be dark green. Ralph inspected the whole thirty yards carefully and then plunged in. The water was warmer than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath.
Piggy appeared again, sat on the rocky ledge, and watched Ralph's green and white body enviously.
You can't half swim.
Piggy.
Piggy took off his shoes and socks, ranged them carefully on the ledge, and tested the water with one toe.
It's hot!
What did you expect?
I didn't expect nothing. My auntie--
Sucks to your auntie!
Ralph did a surface dive and swam under water with his eyes open; the sandy edge of the pool loomed up like a hillside. He turned over, holding his nose, and a golden light danced and shattered just over his face. Piggy was looking determined and began to take off his shorts. Presently he was palely and fatly naked. He tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool, and sat there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at Ralph.
Aren't you going to swim?
Piggy shook his head.
I can't swim. I wasn't allowed. My asthma--
Sucks to your ass-mar!
Piggy bore this with a sort of humble patience. You can't half swim well.
Ralph paddled backwards down the slope, immersed his mouth and blew a jet of water into the air. Then he lifted his chin and spoke.
I could swim when I was five. Daddy taught me. He's a commander in the Navy. When he gets leave he'll come and rescue us. What's your father?
Piggy flushed suddenly.
My dad's dead, he said quickly, and my mum--
He took off his glasses and looked vainly for something with which to clean them.
I used to live with my auntie. She kept a candy store. I used to get ever so many candies. As many as I liked. When'll your dad rescue us?
Soon as he can.
Piggy rose dripping from the water and stood naked, cleaning his glasses with a sock. The only sound that reached them now through the heat of the morning was the long, grinding roar of the breakers on the reef.
How does he know we're here?
Ralph lolled in the water. Sleep enveloped him like the swathing mirages that were wrestling with the brilliance of the lagoon.
How does he know we're here?
Because, thought Ralph, because, because. The roar from the reef became very distant.
They'd tell him at the airport.
Piggy shook his head, put on his flashing glasses and looked down at Ralph.
Not them. Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.
Ralph pulled himself out of the water, stood facing Piggy, and considered this unusual problem.
Piggy persisted.
This an island, isn't it?
I climbed a rock, said Ralph slowly, and I think this is an island.
They're all dead, said Piggy, an' this is an island. Nobody don't know we're here. Your dad don't know, nobody don't know--
His lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist.
We may stay here till we die.
With that word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening weight and the lagoon attacked them with a blinding effulgence.
Get my clothes, muttered Ralph. Along there.
He trotted through the sand, enduring the sun's enmity, crossed the platform and found his scattered clothes. To put on a grey shirt once more was strangely pleasing. Then he climbed the edge of the platform and sat in the green shade on a convenient trunk. Piggy hauled himself up, carrying most of his clothes under his arms. Then he sat carefully on a fallen trunk near the little cliff that fronted the lagoon; and the tangled reflections quivered over him.
Presently he spoke.
We got to find the others. We got to do something.
Ralph said nothing. Here was a coral island. Protected from the sun, ignoring Piggy's ill-omened talk, he dreamed pleasantly.
Piggy insisted.
How many of us are there?
Ralph came forward and stood by Piggy.
I don't know.
Here and there, little breezes crept over the polished waters beneath the haze of heat. When these breezes reached the platform the palm fronds would whisper, so that spots of blurred sunlight slid over their bodies or moved like bright, winged things in the shade.
Piggy looked up at Ralph. All the shadows on Ralph's face were reversed; green above, bright below from the lagoon. A blur of sunlight was crawling across his hair.
We got to do something.
Ralph looked through him. Here at last was the imagined but never fully realized place leaping into real life. Ralph's lips parted in a delighted smile and Piggy, taking this smile to himself as a mark of recognition, laughed with pleasure.
If it really is an island--
What's that?
Ralph had stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon. Something creamy lay among the ferny weeds.
A stone.
No. A shell.
Suddenly Piggy was a-bubble with decorous excitement.
S'right. It's a shell! I seen one like that before. On someone's back wall. A conch he called it. He used to blow it and then his mum would come. It's ever so valuable--
Near to Ralph's elbow a palm sapling leaned out over the lagoon. Indeed, the weight was already pulling a lump from the poor soil and soon it would fall. He tore out the stem and began to poke about in the water, while the brilliant fish flicked away on this side and that. Piggy leaned dangerously.
Careful! You'll break it--
Shut up.
Ralph spoke absently. The shell was interesting and pretty and a worthy plaything; but the vivid phantoms of his day-dream still interposed between him and Piggy, who in this context was an irrelevance. The palm sapling, bending, pushed the shell across the weeds. Ralph used one hand as a fulcrum and pressed down with the other till the shell rose, dripping, and Piggy could make a grab.
Now the shell was no longer a thing seen but not to be touched, Ralph too became excited. Piggy babbled:
--a conch; ever so expensive. I bet if you wanted to buy one, you'd have to pay pounds and pounds and pounds--he had it on his garden wall, and my auntie--
Ralph took the shell from Piggy and a little water ran down his arm. In color the shell was deep cream, touched here and there with fading pink. Between the point, worn away into a little hole, and the pink lips of the mouth, lay eighteen inches of shell with a slight spiral twist and covered with a delicate, embossed pattern. Ralph shook sand out of the deep tube.
--mooed like a cow, he said. He had some white stones too, an' a bird cage with a green parrot. He didn't blow the white stones, of course, an' he said--
Piggy paused for breath and stroked the glistening thing that lay in Ralph's hands.
Ralph!
Ralph looked up.
We can use this to call the others. Have a meeting. They'll come when they hear us--
He beamed at Ralph.
That was what you meant, didn't you? That's why you got the conch out of the water?
Ralph pushed back his fair hair.
How did your friend blow the conch?
He kind of spat, said Piggy. My auntie wouldn't let me blow on account of my asthma. He said you blew from down here. Piggy laid a hand on his jutting abdomen. You try, Ralph. You'll call the others.
Doubtfully, Ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew. There came a rushing sound from its mouth but nothing more. Ralph wiped the salt water off his lips and tried again, but the shell remained silent.
He kind of spat.
Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise. This amused both boys so much that Ralph went on squirting for some minutes, between bouts of laughter.
He blew from down here.
Ralph grasped the idea and hit the shell with air from his diaphragm. Immediately the thing sounded. A deep, harsh note boomed under the palms, spread through the intricacies of the forest and echoed back from the pink granite of the mountain. Clouds of birds rose from the treetops, and something squealed and ran in the undergrowth.
Ralph took the shell away from his lips.
Gosh!
His ordinary voice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the conch. He laid the conch against his lips, took a deep breath and blew once more. The note boomed again: and then at his firmer pressure, the note, fluking up an octave, became a strident blare more penetrating than before. Piggy was shouting something, his face pleased, his glasses flashing. The birds cried, small animals scuttered. Ralph's breath failed; the note dropped the octave, became a low wubber, was a rush of air.
The conch was silent, a gleaming tusk; Ralph's face was dark with breathlessness and the air over the island was full of bird-clamor and echoes ringing.
I bet you can hear that for miles.
Ralph found his breath and blew a series of short blasts.
Piggy exclaimed: There's one!
A child had appeared among the palms, about a hundred yards along the beach. He was a boy of perhaps six years, sturdy and fair, his clothes torn, his face covered with a sticky mess of fruit. His trousers had been lowered for an obvious purpose and had only been pulled back half-way. He jumped off the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles; he stepped out of them and trotted to the platform. Piggy helped him up. Meanwhile Ralph continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest. The small boy squatted in front of Ralph, looking up brightly and vertically. As he received the reassurance of something purposeful being done he began to look satisfied, and his only clean digit, a pink thumb, slid into his mouth.
Piggy leaned down to him.
What's yer name?
Johnny.
Piggy muttered the name to himself and then shouted it to Ralph, who was not interested because he was still blowing. His face was dark with the violent pleasure of making this stupendous noise, and his heart was making the stretched shirt shake. The shouting in the forest was nearer.
Signs of life were visible now on the beach. The sand, trembling beneath the heat haze, concealed many figures in its miles of length; boys were making their way toward the platform through the hot, dumb sand. Three small children, no older than Johnny, appeared from startlingly close at hand, where they had been gorging fruit in the forest. A dark little boy, not much younger than Piggy, parted a tangle of undergrowth, walked on to the platform, and smiled cheerfully at everybody. More and more of them came. Taking their cue from the innocent Johnny, they sat down on the fallen palm trunks and waited. Ralph continued to blow short, penetrating blasts. Piggy moved among the crowd, asking names and frowning to remember them. The children gave him the same simple obedience that they had given to the men with megaphones. Some were naked and carrying their clothes; others half-naked, or more or less dressed, in school uniforms, grey, blue, fawn, jacketed, or jerseyed. There were badges, mottoes even, stripes of color in stockings and pullovers. Their heads clustered above the trunks in the green shade; heads brown, fair, black, chestnut, sandy, mouse-colored; heads muttering, whispering, heads full of eyes that watched Ralph and speculated. Something was being done.
The children who came along the beach, singly or in twos, leapt into visibility when they crossed the line from heat haze to nearer sand. Here, the eye was first attracted to a black, bat-like creature that danced on the sand, and only later perceived the body above it. The bat was the child's shadow, shrunk by the vertical sun to a patch between the hurrying feet. Even while he blew, Ralph noticed the last pair of bodies that reached the platform above a fluttering patch of black. The two boys, bullet-headed and with hair like tow, flung themselves down and lay grinning and panting at Ralph like dogs. They were twins, and the eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication. They breathed together, they grinned together, they were chunky and vital. They raised wet lips at Ralph, for they seemed provided with not quite enough skin, so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths pulled open. Piggy bent his flashing glasses to them and could be heard between the blasts, repeating their names.
Sam, Eric, Sam, Eric.
Then he got muddled; the twins shook their heads and pointed at each other and the crowd laughed.
At last Ralph ceased to blow and sat there, the conch trailing from one hand, his head bowed on his knees. As the echoes died away so did the laughter, and there was silence.
Within the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along. Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing. The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing. Shorts, shirts, and different garments they carried in their hands; but each boy wore a square black cap with a silver badge on it. Their bodies, from throat to ankle, were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross on the left breast and each neck was finished off with a hambone frill. The heat of the tropics, the descent, the search for food, and now this sweaty march along the blazing beach had given them the complexions of newly washed plums. The boy who controlled them was dressed in the same way though his cap badge was golden. When his party was about ten yards from the platform he shouted an order and they halted, gasping, sweating, swaying in the fierce light. The boy himself came forward, vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying, and peered into what to him was almost complete darkness.
Where's the man with the trumpet?
Ralph, sensing his sun-blindness, answered him.
There's no man with a trumpet. Only me.
The boy came close and peered down at Ralph, screwing up his face as he did so. What he saw of the fair-haired boy with the creamy shell on his knees did not seem to satisfy him. He turned quickly, his black cloak circling.
Isn't there a ship, then?
Inside the floating cloak he was tall, thin, and bony; and his hair was red beneath the black cap. His face was crumpled and freckled, and ugly without silliness. Out of this face stared two light blue eyes, frustrated now, and turning, or ready to turn, to anger.
Isn't there a man here?
Ralph spoke to his back.
No. We're having a meeting. Come and join in.
The group of cloaked boys began to scatter from close line. The tall boy shouted at them.
Choir! Stand still!
Wearily obedient, the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in the sun. None the less, some began to protest faintly.
But, Merridew. Please, Merridew . . . can't we?
Then one of the boys flopped on his face in the sand and the line broke up. They heaved the fallen boy to the platform and let him lie. Merridew, his eyes staring, made the best of a bad job.
All right then. Sit down. Let him alone.
But Merridew.
He's always throwing a faint, said Merridew. He did in Gib.; and Addis; and at matins over the precentor.
This last piece of shop brought sniggers from the choir, who perched like black birds on the criss-cross trunks and examined Ralph with interest. Piggy asked no names. He was intimidated by this uniformed superiority and the offhand authority in Merridew's voice. He shrank to the other side of Ralph and busied himself with his glasses.
Merridew turned to Ralph.
Aren't there any grownups?
No.
Merridew sat down on a trunk and looked round the circle.
Then we'll have to look after ourselves.
Secure on the other side of Ralph, Piggy spoke timidly.
That's why Ralph made a meeting. So as we can decide what to do. We've heard names. That's Johnny. Those two--they're twins, Sam 'n Eric. Which is Eric--? You? No--you're Sam--
I'm Sam--
'n I'm Eric.
We'd better all have names, said Ralph, so I'm Ralph.
We got most names, said Piggy. Got 'em just now.
Kids' names, said Merridew. Why should I be Jack? I'm Merridew.
Ralph turned to him quickly. This was the voice of one who knew his own mind.
Then, went on Piggy, that boy--I forget--
You're talking too much, said Jack Merridew. Shut up, Fatty.
Laughter arose.
He's not Fatty, cried Ralph, his real name's Piggy!
Piggy!
Piggy!
Oh, Piggy!
A storm of laughter arose and even the tiniest child joined in. For the moment the boys were a closed circuit of sympathy with Piggy outside: he went very pink, bowed his head and cleaned his glasses again.
Finally the laughter died away and the naming continued. There was Maurice, next in size among the choir boys to Jack, but broad and grinning all the time. There was a slight, furtive boy whom no one knew, who kept to himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and secrecy. He muttered that his name was Roger and was silent again. Bill, Robert, Harold, Henry; the choir boy who had fainted sat up against a palm trunk, smiled pallidly at Ralph and said that his name was Simon.
Jack spoke.
We've got to decide about being rescued.
There was a buzz. One of the small boys, Henry, said that he wanted to go home.
Shut up, said Ralph absently. He lifted the conch. Seems to me we ought to have a chief to decide things.
A chief! A chief!
I ought to be chief, said Jack with simple arrogance, because I'm chapter chorister and head boy. I can sing C sharp.
Another buzz.
Well then, said Jack, I--
He hesitated. The dark boy, Roger, stirred at last and spoke up.
Let's have a vote.
Yes!
Vote for chief!
Let's vote--
This toy of voting was almost as pleasing as the conch. Jack started to protest but the clamor changed from the general wish for a chief to an election by acclaim of Ralph himself. None of the boys could have found good reason for this; what intelligence had been shown was traceable to Piggy while the most obvious leader was Jack. But there was a stillness about Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size, and attractive appearance; and most obscurely, yet most powerfully, there was the conch. The being that had blown that, had sat waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees, was set apart.
Him with the shell.
Ralph! Ralph!
Let him be chief with the trumpet-thing.
Ralph raised a hand for silence.
All right. Who wants Jack for chief?
With dreary obedience the choir raised their hands.
Who wants me?
Every hand outside the choir except Piggy's was raised immediately. Then Piggy, too, raised his hand grudgingly into the air.
Ralph counted.
I'm chief then.
The circle of boys broke into applause. Even the choir applauded; and the freckles on Jack's face disappeared under a blush of mortification. He started up, then changed his mind and sat down again while the air rang. Ralph looked at him, eager to offer something.
The choir belongs to you, of course.
They could be the army--
Or hunters--
They could be--
The suffusion drained away from Jack's face. Ralph waved again for silence.
Jack's in charge of the choir. They can be--what do you want them to be?
Hunters.
Jack and Ralph smiled at each other with shy liking. The rest began to talk eagerly.
Jack stood up.
All right, choir. Take off your togs.
As if released from class, the choir boys stood up, chattered, piled their black cloaks on the grass. Jack laid his on the trunk by Ralph. His grey shorts were sticking to him with sweat. Ralph glanced at them admiringly, and when Jack saw his glance he explained.
I tried to get over that hill to see if there was water all round. But your shell called us.
Ralph smiled and held up the conch for silence.
Listen, everybody. I've got to have time to think things out. I can't decide what to do straight off. If this isn't an island we might be rescued straight away. So we've got to decide if this is an island. Everybody must stay round here and wait and not go away. Three of us--if we take more we'd get all mixed, and lose each other--three of us will go on an expedition and find out. I'll go, and Jack, and, and . . .
He looked round the circle of eager faces. There was no lack of boys to choose from.
And Simon.
The boys round Simon giggled, and he stood up, laughing a little. Now that the pallor of his faint was over, he was a skinny, vivid little boy, with a glance coming up from under a hut of straight hair that hung down, black and coarse.
He nodded at Ralph.
I'll come.
And I--
Jack snatched from behind him a sizable sheath-knife and clouted it into a trunk. The buzz rose and died away.
Piggy stirred.
I'll come.
Ralph turned to him.
You're no good on a job like this.
All the same--
We don't want you, said Jack, flatly. Three's enough.
Piggy's glasses flashed.
I was with him when he found the conch. I was with him before anyone else was.
Jack and the others paid no attention. There was a general dispersal. Ralph, Jack and Simon jumped off the platform and walked along the sand past the bathing pool. Piggy hung bumbling behind them.
If Simon walks in the middle of us, said Ralph, then we could talk over his head.
The three of them fell into step. This meant that every now and then Simon had to do a double shuffle to catch up with the others. Presently Ralph stopped and turned back to Piggy.
Look.
Jack and Simon pretended to notice nothing. They walked on.
You can't come.
Piggy's glasses were misted again--this time with humiliation.
You told 'em. After what I said.
His face flushed, his mouth trembled.
After I said I didn't want--
What on earth are you talking about?
About being called Piggy. I said I didn't care as long as they didn't call me Piggy; an' I said not to tell and then you went an' said straight out--
Stillness descended on them. Ralph, looking with more understanding at Piggy, saw that he was hurt and crushed. He hovered between the two courses of apology or further insult.
Better Piggy than Fatty, he said at last, with the directness of genuine leadership, and anyway, I'm sorry if you feel like that. Now go back, Piggy, and take names. That's your job. So long.
He turned and raced after the other two. Piggy stood and the rose of indignation faded slowly from his cheeks. He went back to the platform.
The three boys walked briskly on the sand. The tide was low and there was a strip of weed-strewn beach that was almost as firm as a road. A kind of glamour was spread over them and the scene and they were conscious of the glamour and made happy by it. They turned to each other, laughing excitedly, talking, not listening. The air was bright. Ralph, faced by the task of translating all this into an explanation, stood on his head and fell over. When they had done laughing, Simon stroked Ralph's arm shyly; and they had to laugh again.
Come on, said Jack presently, we're explorers.
We'll go to the end of the island, said Ralph, and look round the corner.
If it is an island--
Now, toward the end of the afternoon, the mirages were settling a little. They found the end of the island, quite distinct, and not magicked out of shape or sense. There was a jumble of the usual squareness, with one great block sitting out in the lagoon. Sea birds were nesting there.
Like icing, said Ralph, on a pink cake.
We shan't see round this corner, said Jack, because there isn't one. Only a slow curve--and you can see, the rocks get worse--
Ralph shaded his eyes and followed the jagged outline of the crags up toward the mountain. This part of the beach was nearer the mountain than any other that they had seen.
We'll try climbing the mountain from here, he said. I should think this is the easiest way. There's less of that jungly stuff; and more pink rock. Come on.
The three boys began to scramble up. Some unknown force had wrenched and shattered these cubes so that they lay askew, often piled diminishingly on each other. The most usual feature of the rock was a pink cliff surmounted by a skewed block; and that again surmounted, and that again, till the pinkness became a stack of balanced rock projecting through the looped fantasy of the forest creepers. Where the pink cliffs rose out of the ground there were often narrow tracks winding upwards. They could edge along them, deep in the plant world, their faces to the rock.
What made this track?
Jack paused, wiping the sweat from his face. Ralph stood by him, breathless.
Men?
Jack shook his head.
Animals.
Ralph peered into the darkness under the trees. The forest minutely vibrated.
Come on.
The difficulty was not the steep ascent round the shoulders of rock, but the occasional plunges through the undergrowth to get to the next path. Here the roots and stems of creepers were in such tangles that the boys had to thread through them like pliant needles. Their only guide, apart from the brown ground and occasional flashes of light through the foliage, was the tendency of slope: whether this hole, laced as it was with the cables of creeper, stood higher than that.
Somehow, they moved up.
Immured in these tangles, at perhaps their most difficult moment, Ralph turned with shining eyes to the others.
Wacco.
Wizard.
Smashing.
The cause of their pleasure was not obvious. All three were hot, dirty and exhausted. Ralph was badly scratched. The creepers were as thick as their thighs and left little but tunnels for further penetration. Ralph shouted experimentally and they listened to the muted echoes.
This is real exploring, said Jack. I bet nobody's been here before.
We ought to draw a map, said Ralph, only we haven't any paper.
We could make scratches on bark, said Simon, and rub black stuff in.
Again came the solemn communion of shining eyes in the gloom.
Wacco.
Wizard.
There was no place for standing on one's head. This time Ralph expressed the intensity of his emotion by pretending to knock Simon down; and soon they were a happy, heaving pile in the under-dusk.
When they had fallen apart Ralph spoke first.
Got to get on.
The pink granite of the next cliff was further back from the creepers and trees so that they could trot up the path. This again led into more open forest so that they had a glimpse of the spread sea. With openness came the sun; it dried the sweat that had soaked their clothes in the dark, damp heat. At last the way to the top looked like a scramble over pink rock, with no more plunging through darkness. The boys chose their way through defiles and over heaps of sharp stone.
Look! Look!
High over this end of the island, the shattered rocks lifted up their stacks and chimneys. This one, against which Jack leaned, moved with a grating sound when they pushed.
Come on--
But not Come on to the top. The assault on the summit must wait while the three boys accepted this challenge. The rock was as large as a small motor car.
Heave!
Sway back and forth, catch the rhythm.
Heave!
Increase the swing of the pendulum, increase, increase, come up and bear against that point of furthest balance-- increase--increase--
Heave!
The great rock loitered, poised on one toe, decided not to return, moved through the air, fell, struck, turned over, leapt droning through the air and smashed a deep hole in the canopy of the forest. Echoes and birds flew, white and pink dust floated, the forest further down shook as with the passage of an enraged monster: and then the island was still.
Wacco!
Like a bomb!
Whee-aa-oo!
Not for five minutes could they drag themselves away from this triumph. But they left at last.
The way to the top was easy after that. As they reached the last stretch Ralph stopped.
Golly!
They were on the lip of a circular hollow in the side of the mountain.
This was filled with a blue flower, a rock plant of some sort, and the overflow hung down the vent and spilled lavishly among the canopy of the forest. The air was thick with butterflies, lifting, fluttering, settling.
Beyond the hollow was the square top of the mountain and soon they were standing on it.
They had guessed before that this was an island: clambering among the pink rocks, with the sea on either side, and the crystal heights of air, they had known by some instinct that the sea lay on every side.  But there seemed something more fitting in leaving the last word till they stood on the top, and could see a circular horizon of water.
Ralph turned to the others.
This belongs to us.
It was roughly boat-shaped: humped near this end with behind them the jumbled descent to the shore. On either side rocks, cliffs, treetops and a steep slope: forward there, the length of the boat, a tamer descent, tree-clad, with hints of pink: and then the jungly flat of the island, dense green, but drawn at the end to a pink tail. There, where the island petered out in water, was another island; a rock, almost detached, standing like a fort, facing them across the green with one bold, pink bastion.
The boys surveyed all this, then looked out to sea. They were high up and the afternoon had advanced; the view was not robbed of sharpness by mirage.
That's a reef. A coral reef. I've seen pictures like that.
The reef enclosed more than one side of the island, lying perhaps a mile out and parallel to what they now thought of as their beach. The coral was scribbled in the sea as though a giant had bent down to reproduce the shape of the island in a flowing chalk line but tired before he had finished. Inside was peacock water, rocks and weeds showing as in an aquarium; outside was the dark blue of the sea. The tide was running so that long streaks of foam tailed away from the reef and for a moment they felt that the boat was moving steadily astern.
Jack pointed down.
That's where we landed.
Beyond falls and cliffs there was a gash visible in the trees; there were the splintered trunks and then the drag, leaving only a fringe of palm between the scar and the sea. There, too, jutting into the lagoon, was the platform, with insect-like figures moving near it.
Ralph sketched a twining line from the bald spot on which they stood down a slope, a gully, through flowers, round and down to the rock where the scar started.
That's the quickest way back.
Eyes shining, mouths open, triumphant, they savored the right of domination. They were lifted up: were friends.
There's no village smoke, and no boats, said Ralph wisely. We'll make sure later; but I think it's uninhabited.
We'll get food, cried Jack. Hunt. Catch things. until they fetch us.
Simon looked at them both, saying nothing but nodding till his black hair flopped backwards and forwards: his face was glowing.
Ralph looked down the other way where there was no reef.
Steeper, said Jack.
Ralph made a cupping gesture.
That bit of forest down there . . . the mountain holds it up.
Every point of the mountain held up trees--flowers and trees. Now the forest stirred, roared, flailed. The nearer acres of rock flowers fluttered and for half a minute the breeze blew cool on their faces.
Ralph spread his arms.
All ours.
They laughed and tumbled and shouted on the mountain.
I'm hungry.
When Simon mentioned his hunger the others became aware of theirs.
Come on, said Ralph. We've found out what we wanted to know.
They scrambled down a rock slope, dropped among flowers and made their way under the trees. Here they paused and examined the bushes round them curiously.
Simon spoke first.
Like candles. Candle bushes. Candle buds.
The bushes were dark evergreen and aromatic and the many buds were waxen green and folded up against the light. Jack slashed at one with his knife and the scent spilled over them.
Candle buds.
You couldn't light them, said Ralph. They just look like candles.
Green candles, said Jack contemptuously. We can't eat them. Come on.
They were in the beginnings of the thick forest, plonking with weary feet on a track, when they heard the noises--squeakings--and the hard strike of hoofs on a path. As they pushed forward the squeaking increased till it became a frenzy. They found a piglet caught in a curtain of creepers, throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extreme terror. Its voice was thin, needle-sharp and insistent; The three boys rushed forward and Jack drew his knife again with a flourish. He raised his arm in the air. There came a pause, a hiatus, the pig continued to scream and the creepers to jerk, and the blade continued to flash at the end of a bony arm. The pause was only long enough for them to understand what an enormity the downward stroke would be. Then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and scurried into the undergrowth. They were left looking at each other and the place of terror. Jack's face was white under the freckles. He noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm down replacing the blade in the sheath. Then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to climb back to the track.
I was choosing a place, said Jack. I was just waiting for a moment to decide where to stab him.
You should stick a pig, said Ralph fiercely. They always talk about sticking a pig.
You cut a pig's throat to let the blood out, said Jack, otherwise you can't eat the meat.
Why didn't you--?
They knew very well why he hadn't: because of the enormity of the knife descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood.
I was going to, said Jack. He was ahead of them, and they could not see his face. I was choosing a place. Next time--!
He snatched his knife out of the sheath and slammed it into a tree trunk. Next time there would be no mercy. He looked round fiercely, daring them to contradict. Then they broke out into the sunlight and for a while they were busy finding and devouring food as they moved down the scar toward the platform and the meeting.3"
The Blackest Day,Lana Del Rey,"Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
Carry me home, got my new coat and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listenin' to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
And all I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
