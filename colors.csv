​m.A.A.d city,Kendrick Lamar,"​m.A.A.d city Lyrics
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, Ayy, y'all—duck!
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—

Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. Compton's Human Sacrifice
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?
​m.A.A.d city
Compton
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that2.2KEmbed"
A Million Dreams,Ziv Zaifman,"A Million Dreams Lyrics
I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see it

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
For the world we're gonna make81Embed"
Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst,Kendrick Lamar,"Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst Lyrics
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering Get 'em!
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that Sorry for your loss shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like It need to be told
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh


(On the phone)
Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?
Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!
Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.
We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.
Bring a nigga back a black!
Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.
Bring a nigga back a black!
(*Hangs up*)
Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?
Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say fuck the world, my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
Lord God, I come to You a sinner.
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
And I humbly repent for my sins.
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
I believe that Jesus is Lord.
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
I believe you raised Him from the dead.
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
I would ask that Jesus come into my life.
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
And be my Lord and Savior.
(And be my Lord and Savior)
I receive Jesus to take control of my life.
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
And that I may live for Him from this day forward.
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood.
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
In Jesus' name, amen.
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life215Embed"

FEAR.,Kendrick Lamar,"FEAR. Lyrics
Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)

What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

Devil in a New Dress,Kanye West,"Devil in a New Dress Lyrics

Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, This what you really wanted, huh?
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's Dior Homme, not Dior, homie
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

The Art of Peer Pressure,Kendrick Lamar,"The Art of Peer Pressure Lyrics

Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still nigga, what is you sayin'?
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: Hello? What you doin'? — Kickin' it.
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

Glow Like Dat,Rich Brian,"Glow Like Dat Lyrics
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers (yuh)

I be on my Mac DeMarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves cloves cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (Ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (Ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (Ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (Yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (Skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (Skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

All these parties I attend, but never know the celebration
I let you do what you want, no need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go, but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings, but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin' 'bout the things that you pursue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (Ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (Ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (Ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (Yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (Skrrr, skrrr)

Yeah, I be on my Mac DeMarco shit

A Thousand Years,Christina Perri,"A Thousand Years Lyrics
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm
Afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything
Take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more142Embed"
ME!,Taylor Swift,"ME! Lyrics
I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Girl, there ain't no I in team
But you know there is a me
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in team
But you know there is a me
And you can't spell awesome without me
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)

Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, Here it go
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

I'm saying it like...
I want a daughter like Nicki, aw, man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no ménages
I don't know how you saying it but, let 'em hear this107Embed"
Colors,Halsey,"Colors Lyrics
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue156Embed"

The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
(Brave)
I'm not brave

I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes, I've
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell

Speaking of nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon

Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further

Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

​illicit affairs,Taylor Swift,"​illicit affairs Lyrics
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times81Embed"
​tolerate it,Taylor Swift,"​tolerate it Lyrics
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I sit and watch you68Embed"
Come Alive,Hugh Jackman, Keala Settle, Daniel Everidge, Zendaya & The Greatest Showman Ensemble,"Come Alive Lyrics
You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake

'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!

I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

No more living in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes

'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

We will be the light that's turning
Bottle up but keep on shining
You can prove there's more to you

You cannot be afraid

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
So, come alive!

Come one!
Come all!
Come in!
Come on!
To anyone who's bursting with a dream

Come one!
Come all!
You hear
The call

To anyone who's searching for a way to break free

Break free!
Break free!

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
(Hey!)

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

Story of My Life,One Direction,"Story of My Life Lyrics
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (Give her hope)

I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, How do you do?
They're really saying, I love you

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know

Hate It or Love It,The Game,"Hate It or Love It Lyrics

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, Check, check out my melody
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
Complexion (Two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (Two-step)
It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, A woman is woman, love the creation
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
Complexion (Two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (Two-step)
It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain’t a thing
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth109Embed"
Good Ass Intro,Chance the Rapper,"Good Ass Intro Lyrics
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Yo, we back)
I'm good, ooh, yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
(We back and we back and we back)
So good
(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time

Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good, igh
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
I'm good, so good
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm good (Even better than I was the last time)
So good

Work, work, work, work, bang, nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, The Rapper
Magical word (Poof), please say Kadabra
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck, a nigga's fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
Ooh, yeah, I'm good, so good (I'm good, I'm good)
Even better than I was the last time, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(I'm better than the last time, yeah, yeah)
I'm good (I'm gonna be)
So good

Even better than I was, even better than I was

Even better than I was, even better than I was

Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, We don't love them hoes
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer, let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

Hey (No, no)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle (No, no, yeah)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
(We know, we know, we know)
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing, yeah
But nothing can compare to when you're naked (Hey!)
(Perfect when you naked, together with you)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
I just had to let you know

BTS (방탄소년단) - Blue & Grey (English Translation),Genius English Translations,"BTS (방탄소년단) - Blue & Grey (English Translation) Lyrics
Where is my angel?
The end of a tiring day
Someone come and save me, please
Is overshadowed by a sigh
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The tears reflected in the mirror mean
My colors hid in the smile, blue and grey

I really don’t know what went wrong
I grew up with a blue question mark in my mind
Maybe that’s why I’ve been fighting for my life
But looking behind, I’m standing hеre dazed
The powеrful shadow swallows me
The question mark is still blue
Is it anxiety or depression?
Am I just an animal that regrets
Or is it me born out of loneliness?
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't get eaten away, I'll find the exit

I just wanna be happier
Melt me, I'm cold
I've reached out my hand countless times
The echo is colorless
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself 
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
I still feel my heart
Breathe faster like when
I walked on the cold winter streets
Don't say you're fine
'Cause you're not
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much

The road I always walk and the light I always receive
But today seems like an unfamiliar scene
Have I become used to it or have I collapsed?
This piece of metal does feel heavy
A grey rhino approaches
I just stand there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like 'color' embarrass me
The wide grey zone is comfortable
With hundreds of millions of grey faces
When it rains, I dance
Over this city, my world
Raise a toast to
The fog on clear days
And all the dust always
Here with me on rainy days
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth in my hands
They're cold, that's why I need more of you
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
If I laugh in the future far away
I'll tell you that I did

After secretly taking back words floating in the air
I now fall asleep at dawn, good night66Embed"
All We Know,The Chainsmokers,"All We Know Lyrics
Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go

Crazy Story,King Von,"Crazy Story Lyrics
Known to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Doe (Bow)
I'ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I’ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on (Von), alright (Von)

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shit, she told me where he be
I said for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like, Von, you already know, just put your girl on fleek
I'm like, Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want, some shoes?
Jimmy Choo? With a handbag, too? Red or baby blue?
She get to smilin’, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughin', coulda been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speedin', coulda been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, coulda been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it’s like six, told her hit his phone, meet her in The Wic
But he ain’t go, but he ain't that slow, say meet ’em at the store
I'm like cool, let 'em front his move, do what he gon' do
’Cause this the plot, put 'em in the pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot, but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot​, but that just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6-24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pullin' up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fourth
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
Block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happen, I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lacking, 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out, What's crackin'?
I'm like, What? I'm like, Nigga who? I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang when it comes​ to chains
So I rise, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh, this no lie
Bitch it's do or die, you said you gon' slide

Fade Into You,Mazzy Star,"Fade Into You Lyrics
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of light into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew


A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
A million smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew66Embed"

Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, There he go!
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

Ayy, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, hoe
Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Bimmer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?
She know a nigga be stuntin' like a Power Ranger
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, There he go!
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

These ain't Ray-Bans, these Saint Laurent shades, ho
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up

This Is Home,Cavetown,"This Is Home Lyrics
Often, I am upset
That I cannot fall in love, but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll cut my hair
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
To make you stare
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll hide my chest
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My eyes went dark
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't know where
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh

Time is
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Slowly

But strangely he feels at home in this place77Embed"
Firework,Katy Perry,"Firework Lyrics
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, Aah, aah, aah
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

8 Mile,Eminem,"8 Mile Lyrics
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'

You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Alfred’s Theme,Eminem,"Alfred’s Theme Lyrics
Before I check the mic (Check, check, one, two)
I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (Good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (Yeah) give zero fucks, then I (Yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (Uh), cup my nuts, then I (Yeah)
Check my ball hair (What?), make sure it's all there (Yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (Yeah)
It's Music to Bе Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I (Only one eye) got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like *snores*
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands
Shit, hold on, man
Motherfuck
Happy birthday to—
Fuck (Shh, quiet)

I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

What the fuck? Hold on, wait
I'm Diddy's side bitch?
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)
From the MMLP to (Huh?) MTBMB (Bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)
So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)
Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)
My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, Chirp, chirp
I said, Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy her designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)
And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)
Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole
Wait, why'd the beat cut off?

Get Free,Lana Del Rey,"Get Free Lyrics
Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For… and for… (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

The Great Gatsby (Chapter III),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"The Great Gatsby (Chapter III) LyricsThere was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York — every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.
By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.
Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited — they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it — signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to some one before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.
“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.
“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to——” She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps.
“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”
“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.
“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.
“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”
It was for Lucille, too.
“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”
“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.
“Sure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”
“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with ANYbody.”
“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.
“Gatsby. Somebody told me——”
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.
“I don’t think it’s so much THAT,” argued Lucille sceptically; “it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively.
“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country-side—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour. “This is much too polite for me.”
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas
A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot
“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously
“About what?” He waved his hand toward the book-shelves
“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”
“The books?”
He nodded
“Absolutely real — have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and — Here! Lemme show you.”
Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the “Stoddard Lectures.”
“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too — didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse
“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering
“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”
“Has it?”
“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re ——”
“You told us.” We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts.” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.
“Your face is familiar,” he said, politely. “Weren’t you in the Third Division during the war?”
“Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion.”
“I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”
We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.
“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”
“What time?”
“Any time that suits you best.”
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.
“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there——” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.” For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.
“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”
“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”
He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself, a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.
“Who is he?” I demanded.
“Do you know?”
“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”
“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”
“Now YOU’RE started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.” A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away.
“However, I don’t believe it.”
“Why not?” “I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers, you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.
“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as Vladimir Tostoff’s JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD.”
The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.
“I beg your pardon.”
Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.
“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”
“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.
“Yes, madame.”
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”
“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”
“We’re always the first ones to leave.”
“So are we.”
“Well, we’re almost the last to-night,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”
In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say good-bye.
Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long were we in there?”
“Why, about an hour.” “It was—simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully in my face: “Please come and see me. . . . Phone book . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard . . . My aunt . . .” She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.
“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane to-morrow morning, at nine o’clock.”
Then the butler, behind his shoulder: “Philadelphia wants you on the ‘phone, sir.”
“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there. . . . good night.”
“Good night.”
“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. “Good night, old sport. . . . good night.”
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupe which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.
“How’d it happen?”
He shrugged his shoulders.
“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.
“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?” “Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”
“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”
“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
“Do you want to commit suicide?”
“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!”
“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.
“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”
“Look!”
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
“It came off,” some one explained.
He nodded.
“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:
“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”
At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.
“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”
“But the WHEEL’S off!”
He hesitated.
“No harm in trying,” he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.
Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.
I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.
I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.
Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.
It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.
“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”
“I am careful.”
“No, you’re not.”
“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.
“What’s that got to do with it?”
“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”
“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”
“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”
Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.31Embed"

The Great Gatsby (Chapter VII),F. Scott Fitzgerald,"The Great Gatsby (Chapter VII) LyricsIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.
“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”
“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir.” in a dilatory, grudging way.
“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”
“Who?” he demanded rudely.
“Carraway.”
“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.
My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.
Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.
“Going away?” I inquired.
“No, old sport.”
“I hear you fired all your servants.”
“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”
So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.
“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”
“I see.”
He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.
The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.
“Oh, my!” she gasped.
I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.
“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?”
My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!
. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.
“The master’s body!” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”
What he really said was: “Yes . . . yes . . . I’ll see.”
He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.
“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.
The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.
“We can’t move,” they said together.
Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.
“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.
Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.
Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.
“The rumor is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”
We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all. . . . I’m under no obligations to you at all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”
“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.
“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”
Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.
“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . .”
“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.
As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.
“You know I love you,” she murmured.
“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.
Daisy looked around doubtfully.
“You kiss Nick too.”
“What a low, vulgar girl!”
“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.
“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”
The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.
“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”
Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small, reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.
“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.
“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small, white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”
“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”
“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”
“Where’s Daddy?”
“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”
Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.
“Come, Pammy.”
“Good-by, sweetheart!”
With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.
Gatsby took up his drink.
“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.
We drank in long, greedy swallows.
“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.
“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”
I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.
“I’m right across from you.”
“So you are.”
Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.
“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”
We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.
“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”
“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”
“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”
Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its senselessness into forms.
“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”
“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”
Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.
“You always look so cool,” she repeated.
She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.
“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man ——”
“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re all going to town.”
He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.
“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”
His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.
“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?”
“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”
“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.” He didn’t answer.
“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”
They went up-stairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.
“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.
“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”
“Oh.”
A pause.
“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads——”
“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.
“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom. He went inside.
Gatsby turned to me rigidly:
“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”
“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of——” I hesitated.
“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.
That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .
Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.
“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”
“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.
“Yes.”
“Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.”
The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.
“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.
“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.”
A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.
“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”
He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.
“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.”
She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.
“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.
“See what?”
He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.
“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science——”
He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss.
“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I could have gone deeper if I’d known——”
“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.
“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”
“About Gatsby.”
“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”
“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.
“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”
“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”
“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.”
“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.
“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!”
We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.
“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.
“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.” Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.
“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”
“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”
“What’s the matter?”
“I’m all run down.”
“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”
With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.
“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”
“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”
“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.
“Like to buy it?”
“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.”
“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”
“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”
“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.
“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”
The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.
“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.
“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”
“What do I owe you?”
“Dollar twenty.”
The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.
“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over to-morrow afternoon.”
That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.
In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.
There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easy-going blue coupe.
“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when every one’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”
The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupe came to a stop, and Daisy signaled us to draw up alongside.
“Where are we going?” she cried.
“How about the movies?”
“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly, “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”
“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”
Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.
But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.
The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea.”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .
The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted Only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.
“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and every one laughed.
“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.
“There aren’t any more.”
“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe——”
“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”
He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.
“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”
There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me.”—but this time no one laughed.
“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.
“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.
“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.
“What is?”
“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”
“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”
As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.
“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.
“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered, “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”
“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.
“A man named Biloxi. ‘blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”
“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”
“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.
“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use to-day.”
The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea-ea-ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.
“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”
“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”
“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”
“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”
“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”
Jordan smiled.
“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”
Tom and I looked at each other blankly.
“Biloxi?”
“First place, we didn’t have any president——”
Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.
“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”
“Not exactly.”
“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”
“Yes—I went there.”
A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting: “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”
Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but, the silence was unbroken by his “thank you.” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.
“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.
“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”
“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”
Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.
“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”
I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.
Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.
“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”
“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”
“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.
“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”
They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.
“He isn’t causing a row.” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”
“Self-control!” Repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”
Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.
“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.
“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”
Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.
“I’ve got something to tell YOU, old sport——” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.
“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”
“That’s a good idea.” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”
“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”
“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”
“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.
Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.
“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!”
At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.
“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”
“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”
Tom turned to Daisy sharply.
“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”
“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes.”—but there was no laughter in his eyes——” to think that you didn’t know.”
“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.
“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”
“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.
“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”
“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”
Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.
“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.”
She looked at him blindly. “Why — how could I love him — possibly?”
“You never loved him.”
She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late
“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance
“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.
“No.”
From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.
“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone.. .. “Daisy?”
“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said — but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet
“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once — but I loved you too.”
Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed
“You loved me too?” he repeated
“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”
The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby
“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now ——”
“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”
“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom
She turned to her husband
“As if it mattered to you,” she said
“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”
“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.”
“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”
“Daisy’s leaving you.”
“Nonsense.”
“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort
“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”
“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”
“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further to-morrow.”
“You can suit yourself about that, old sport.” said Gatsby steadily.
“I found out what your ‘drug-stores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”
“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”
“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU.”
“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”
“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”
That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.
“That drug-store business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”
I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.
It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.
The voice begged again to go.
“PLEASE, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”
Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage, she had had, were definitely gone.
“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”
She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.
“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.”
They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.
After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.
“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?”
I didn’t answer.
“Nick?” He asked again.
“What?”
“Want any?”
“No . . . I just remembered that to-day’s my birthday.”
I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.
It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupe with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.
So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.
“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move away.”
Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.
So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs in the garage.
“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”
A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.
The “death car.” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.
Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.
We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.
“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”
He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.
“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”
I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupe and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.
“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.
He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.
The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.
Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:
“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od!”
Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.
“M-a-y-.” the policeman was saying, “-o——”
“No, r-.” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o——”
“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.
“r” said the policeman, “o——”
“g——”
“g——” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What you want, fella?”
“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”
“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”
“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.
“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”
“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”
“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.
“One goin’ each way. Well, she.”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side——” she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’york knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”
“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.
“Hasn’t got any name.”
A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.
“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”
“See the accident?” asked the policeman.
“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”
“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”
Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries:
“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”
Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.
“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.
Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.
“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupe we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”
Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.
“What’s all that?” he demanded.
“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it . . . it was a yellow car.”
Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.
“And what color’s your car?”
“It’s a blue car, a coupe.”
“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.
Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.
“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct——” Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.
“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”
Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.
Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupe raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.
“The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”
The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.
“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.
“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do to-night.”
A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.
“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”
“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”
Jordan put her hand on my arm.
“Won’t you come in, Nick?”
“No, thanks.”
I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.
“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.
I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.
I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.
“What are you doing?” I inquired.
“Just standing here, old sport.”
Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of ‘Wolfshiem’s people,’ behind him in the dark shrubbery.
“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.
“Yes.”
He hesitated.
“Was she killed?”
“Yes.”
“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”
He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.
“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”
I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.
“Who was the woman?” he inquired.
“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”
“Well, I tried to swing the wheel——” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.
“Was Daisy driving?”
“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”
“It ripped her open——”
“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.
“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”
“He won’t touch her,’ I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”
“I don’t trust him, old sport.”
“How long are you going to wait?”
“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”
A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows down-stairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor.
“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”
I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.
Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.
They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.
As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.
“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.
“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”
He shook his head.
“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”
He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.31Embed"

BLACK EFFECT,THE CARTERS,"BLACK EFFECT Lyrics
Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say that again

Liquorice,Azealia Banks,"Liquorice Lyrics
Look, niggas really wanna beat they chest for B-A-N-K-S
These niggas be gorillas for the pin-k flesh
These niggas be vanilla, the chips be legitimate
They just want the pumpernickel sis in the linens with 'em
So since you vanilla men spend
Can my hot fudge bitches get with your vanilla friends?
Hey, I’m the liquorice bitch
You know I’m looking for these niggas if these niggas is rich

Do you jiggle your dick when your bitch pop singing on the liquorice hit, ya know

Hi, I wanna get the number to your 212 line

You wanna cuddle with ya bitch after, eh

Lotta scrillac to make, and the dick don’t fuck up any scrillac for Banks
No issues picking money over ha-ha, ya beige in her
She just wanna see the best in Greece with some gentlemen and check these beats in the sun
He just wanna see the wet-wet weave when I’m swimming in the West Indies
Then I sit up and catch these breeze
Sip a little bit of Rum & Ting, nigga

These bitches know that I be on that black girl shit
That black girl pin-up with that black girl dip
Put that black girl spin up on ya whack girl tip
Ain’t official till it been up in that black girl kit
Pick out ya mans and attack real quick, I’ma hit him with that venom and that rap girl hip

Bitches better tan for the summer, and for the haters

And stimulate her
Take a lick up on my genital, then sit to savor
Do ya man’s and his licorice interest a favor

4th Chamber,GZA,"4th Chamber Lyrics
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
(Baby gurgling)
So... come, boy, choose life or death

The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own Fostex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sittin' wine niggas sippin' Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
'Cause I be duckin' crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sippin' rum out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aimin' nozzles, stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Gimme mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don
I judge wisely as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin' between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave 'em split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scalin' your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic, black Hebrew
The year 2002, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads gettin' slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin' with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144,000 chosen
Protons-Electrons-Always-Cause-Explosions
The bank's a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin' to figure who invented
This unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now, watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short-fused50Embed"

No Makeup (Her Vice),Kendrick Lamar,"No Makeup (Her Vice) Lyrics

I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction I've outgrown
I feel like it's not enough
I can never put on too much makeup
Yeah, I know your imperfections, I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
Is that I had a black eye— to be continued, eleven

If I Had,Eminem,"If I Had Lyrics
Life, by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', Where hip-hop lives
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just fed up, that's my word53Embed"

Baby I'm falling head over heels
Looking for ways to let you know just how I feel
I wish I was holding you by my side
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause finally it's real

I'm tryna hold back, you oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast, deeply in love
Finding the magic in the colors of you

You're the right time at the right moment
You're the sunlight, keeps my heart going, woah
Know when I'm with you can't keep myself from falling
Right time at the right moment
It's you
You, it's you
You, it's you

Baby I'm falling deeper in love
Everything that you are is all I'm dreaming of
And if I can break enough to show you that I need us
I'd give up everything I have, girl, just for you
I'm tryna hold back, you oughta know that
You're the one that's on my mind
Falling too fast deeply in love
Girl, all I need to breathe is you

'Cause you're the right time at the right moment
You're the sunlight, keeps my heart going, oh-woah
Know when I'm with you, I can't keep myself from falling

I don't know what I wanna call this bih
Bih call this bih ummm...
Call this bih ummm...
Name this bih ummmm...
Ritz Carlton, bih
We recordin' this bih in the Ritz Carlton right now, ain’t I?

Fuck a shooter, I'm my own shooter
All this ice, I'm my own jeweler
Six lawyers and they're all Jewish
I'm the star, bitch, this my movie
Pinky ring, two-fifty on it
Guess it's safe to say, nigga I spent your budget on it
Ran off on da plug twice
He's steady callin', I ain't callin' back
He said he dissed me on his last album
Guess nobody heard cause nobody bought his last album
I got a Delta, go to Howard
That little pwussy got some power
Born broke but Imma die rich
Lot of these fuck niggas counterfeit

I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton
I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton
Everything on me brand new
Call her a mangler cause she ran through
Say she want me to take the rubber off
Told her people in Hell want ice water bitch knock it off
All the cribs came with elevators
Old schools painted same colors as Now & Laters
Said if you ain't got haters you ain't poppin nigga
I don't rap beef, let's shoot it out, that's how I'm rockin', nigga
Trap money, made six figures
If you're thuggin' out you better keep a rocket with ya'
In front of Neiman's in a black Jag
Told her if the head fire, swear I’ll buy her a new ass
I spend money for the fuck of it (Fuck)
I stay flushin' for the rush of it (Rush)
I wanna have me 'bout ten kids
Give 'em a mil' apiece and tell 'em, Now do what your daddy did!

I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton
I'm just vibin' in the Ritz Carlton
Got the stick, all in Ritz Carlton
Count a mil' right in Ritz Carlton
Wanna fuck me, baby? Pull up at the Ritz Carlton13Embed"

Rainbows, sunshine, go

Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

I thought I told you 'bout it
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
You don't leave home without it

She on my back about it
(C3PO, C3PO, C3PO)
And all the time, oh-oh, yeah
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)

How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair and she know life is better with this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night—go
Rainbows (Ho!), sunshine
Rainbows (Ho!), sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

He slangs his yay through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least, for sure
And they say there's no way, I should stay with someone like you
But I tell them, No
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you
'Cause I know one day you could take me away, far away
I know you could pay all the money you made
There'll be plenty of sunshine

I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
I have my nigga count it, no, no
(Back up them O's, back up them O's, back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold

Crazy Story 2.0,King Von,"Crazy Story 2.0 Lyrics
Known to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Doe (Bow)
I'ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I'ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on (Von), alright (Von)

Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shits, she told me where he be
I say for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like Von, you already know, just put put your girl on fleek
I'm like Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want some shoes?
Jimmy Choo, with a handbag too, red or baby blue?
She get to smiling, she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughing, could've been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speeding, could've been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, could've been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script 'cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it's like six, told her hit his phone
Meet her in The Wic, but he ain't go
But he ain't that slow, said meet him at the store
I'm like cool, let him front his move, do what he gon' do
'Cause this the plot, put him in a pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot, but that's just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6 to 24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pulling up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fork
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
The block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happened:
I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lackin', 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out What's crackin?
I'm like, What?, I'm like, Nigga, who?, I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang, when it comes to chains
So I ride, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh
This no lie, bitch it's do or die, you say you gon' slide?
You got some nerve, yo' shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd
I got a drop on a rappin' nigga, I be from the 'Raq
I'm like, cool, better not front yo' move, or you become a pack
You see Von, you see 40 Glocks, see Booka, you see MAC
Yeah free Mak, gone for a double homi', foenem got yo back
But fuck that, say you smoking who? Quickest way to die
Snatch who chain? Off who neck? Not mine
Ain't no point in trying
They not out, plus the police hot, ain't no point in sliding
They be talking from the internet, they don't be outside
Hit the six, call DaDa out, tell him 'bout a lick
We need tape, we need rope and phones, don't forget the blicks
He like, Cool, how that nigga look? I pull up some flicks
He like, Damn I think I know the nigga He cool with his bitch
We at V-Live, but we went to Structure, but we played a lot
Got a goofy walking in and out, telling me his car
He in a Cat, bet, I'ma pay you half, just finesse
I'm 300, clips don't come like that, three drums to his chest
Boom, boom, boom (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Bitch, we lurking 63rd (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Bitch, we lurking 63rd (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Chaining Day,J. Cole,"Chaining Day Lyrics
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: I see you
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, Here go your chain my nigga
This is chaining day
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)
They even iced out Jesus' hair

Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', Fake it 'til you make it
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)

Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery

I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me

Time for That,Kevin Gates,"Time for That Lyrics
Yeah

Do you think I’ll ever need you, love, more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round still think I'm timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
I'm in a rush, it was nice to meet ya
Collared shirt, no elongated T's, cheaper to be yourself
Ain't no wrong way to be, accomplished a lot
I came from the block, ambitious in the trenches
I got a long way to reach
Sorry if I was offensive, but not at all
You got to pardon me at times, okay problem solved
When I hear the word can't take it like a challenge
I don't understand why the hell I can't have it
Help me understand why the hell I can't have it
I was blessed with a swag and I ain't braggin'
Insecurities get covered with designer fashion
If I'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
If you not feelin' what I'm sayin', sorry for the hassle
But if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic
Do you think I'll ever need you love more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Ain't no relaxin', they pillow fightin' on the sofa
Not at all my main focus though I was hopin'
Pull your hair, kiss it soft while you bendin' over
After that we could shower and I could hold ya
Havin' deep conversation and now you open
Pretendin' that I was asleep while you on the phone
Listen to you tell your girlfriend how I stroke it
Only that it was a foot I already know it, mind blowin'
Phone rang bout to go, is you rollin'
Playin' poker no cards, throwin' hands exposin'
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, slow motion
Kicked out of everywhere, expulsion
Do you think I'll ever need your love more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that.19Embed"

Draped down in Gucci, she rock Givenchy, she matchin' my fly
I know it's wrong, but fuck if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Let's take a trip, if we leave now, we can land tonight
We gon' take a trip to Dubai, guarantee you won't see nobody
Nobody safe where I come from
Young niggas goin' straight dumb
Fifty hollow tips in each drum
Throwing fours up with lil one
Hoppin' out trucks, we suited up, we ready for war, yeah
Yeah that's my boy, that's really my dawg
We went from boys to men
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma give it all I got
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma go straight to the top
I'ma go straight to the top

Rainbow,Kacey Musgraves,"Rainbow Lyrics
When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

Mmm
It'll all be alright19Embed"
Slater,Tyler, The Creator,"Slater Lyrics
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D (Star Trak)
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, (what?) now I kick it in the 'burbs

Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums, with foul flow, dirty mouth, like kissing bums
Mama done made her one, um, a witty son
With no respect for women, so show me your titties hun (what?)
You eighteen? Me? I'm twenty-somethin'
OK, I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, Should he come?
I'ma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics (How's your dick?) Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, ay
Getting T.U., O.F., indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt, like Where's the hooded sleeve?
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (who?) Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit, he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now; Ye's, PJs, sipping leche
Chips Ahoy, boy, listening to Cowboy, ay!
Boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy, ay!
AUS was awes', I enjoyed, boy
Y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi

Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunnyhop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousand turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs
Canons with panorama views
My shoes that seen more vans than Mexicanas
Or crackers in Alabama
G-O-to-the-L-F, this OF
I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga, I (what?) mosh in gardens
Jazz punk shit, playing chords
Making up shit, pardon my Dolly Partons
And I keep shartin'
Hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten

My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars
I, just, wanna, ride, my bike

After Ever After,Jon Cozart,"After Ever After Lyrics
If you've ever wondered why
Disney tales all end in lies
Here's what happened after all their dreams came true
I loved being princess down in this beautiful ocean-blue
But mermaids are going missing, they end up in someone's stew
So, just try to put yourself into somebody else's gills
You're killing my ecosystem with fishing and oil spills (Oh no)
Thank you BP, thank you BP
The British are killing, oil is spilling
Now, I can't see! My eyes!
Chinamen feast on Flounder's fins
Plus the Japanese killed all my whale friends
Oceans are browning, I think I'm drowning
Thanks to BP
You suck!
Hey, I'm okay, but I'm slightly scared
My husband's a mark for the War on Terror
Aladdin was taken by the CIA
We're non-Taliban
You've got the wrong man
In Guantanamo Bay
Prince Ali, where could he be? Drowning in Wawa
Interrogation from the nation of the Free
Bin Laden's taken the fall
We're not trained pilots at all
Jafar went crazy and no one put up a fuss
We're for freedom, Genie can vouch for us
Bush was crazy, Obama's lazy, Al-Qaeda's not in this country
Set free my Prince Ali
A whore! A whore!
A whore, a whore, a whore!
This town's gone wild since I married Adam
They think I'm going straight to hell (She'll burn, in hell)
But the charges laid on me, of bestiality
Could wind-up getting me thrown in a cell (She is a witch)
No, I'm overrun by mad-men (We're all crazy)
I hear they plan to burn me at the stake
(The witch will fry, that Belle must die)
They legit believe I'm Satan
And now I hear that PETA's gonna take my beast away
After John Smith traveled back to England
I helped my people cultivate the fields
More English, French and Spaniards came to visit
And they greeted us with guns and germs and steel
They forced us into unknown lands of exile
They pillaged, raped and left us all for dead
So now, I'm far more liberal with a weapon
When I separate their bodies from their heads (Wait, what?)
Have you ever held the entrails of an English guy?
Or bit the beating hearts of Spanish men?
Can you shoot an arrow in some French guy's eyeball? (Sacrebleu!)
Can you paint with the red colors in these men? (Adios, amigos)
I can murder if I please
'Cause I'm dying of disease
I can paint with the red colors in these men
Thanks to BP

Colors of the Wind (Soundtrack),Judy Kuhn,"Colors of the Wind (Soundtrack) Lyrics
You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still, I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind20Embed"
Difficult,Eminem,"Difficult Lyrics
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life, it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow, I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now—Jesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!
Until we meet again, Doody
Doody, that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like ninety degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, You're gonna fry, you're like, No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skin—we don't burn, meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least 16 years ago
Well, I put 'em in your cask—oww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!
Until we meet again, Doody

And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like Fuck rap!
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin', gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and… what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And that’s on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina’s name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

Red,Taylor Swift,"Red Lyrics
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

On that day, when the sky fell away
Our world came to an end
In our eyes did a fading sun rise
In the dark, glimmering shadows
Silence grows, in the spaces between
Stretching out beyond time
Rising up, as a chorus of souls finds a voice
Flickering through the void
These little sparks cling on to life
Everyone caught in the struggle
And then the storms of change, they fan the flames
Scattering ashes to the wind

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Gleaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
No escape, no greater fate to be made
In the end, the chains of time will not break
Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

As fate spins a thread without end
New life draws its first breath
Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
Where destiny holds fast
Here where we stand, hand clenched in hand
Everyone caught in the struggle
This is the day we finally find our way
Stepping into our tomorrow

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite
From the distance sings a chorus of souls
Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight
Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite
From the distance sings a chorus of souls
Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bear this torch against the cold of the night
Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight30Embed"
Beach Life-in-Death [2018],Car Seat Headrest,"Beach Life-in-Death  LyricsPart I
Last- Last night I drove to Harper's Ferry and I thought about you
There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs
The speed limit kept decreasing by ten
As we entered a town about halfway there
It was almost raining at the train station
We put our hoods on our heads at the train station
We threw rocks into the river
The river underneath the train tracks
And when the train came it was so big and powerful
When it came into the little station
I wanted to put my arms around it
But the conductor looked at me funny
So we had to say goodbye and leave
The Monopoly board still in the backseat
Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town
Ran into the decreasing speed limits again
What should I do? (Eat breakfast)
What should I do? (Eat lunch)
What should I do? (Eat dinner)
What should I do? (Go to bed)
Where can I go? (Go to the store)
Where can I go? (Apply for jobs)
Where can I go? (Go to a friend's)
Where can I go? (Go to bed)
I wrote Beach Death when I thought you were taken
I wrote Beach Funeral when I knew you were taken
I wrote Beach Fagz—well it wasn't about you
But it could've been—well, no, it couldn't have
I spent a week in Ocean City
And came back to find you were gone
I spent a week in Illinois
And came back to find you were still gone
I pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends
I never came out to my friends
We were all on Skype
And I laughed and I changed the subject
She said, what's with this dog motif?
I said,​ do you have something against dogs?
I am almost completely soulless
I am incapable of being human
I am incapable of being inhuman
I am living uncontrollably
It should be called anti-depression
As a friend of mine suggested
Because it's not the sadness that hurts you
It's the brain's reaction against it
It's not enough to love the unreal
I am inseparable from the impossible
I want gravity to stop for me
My soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature
I want a cut scene
I want a cut from your face to my face
I want a cut I want
The next related video
I don't want to go insane
I don't want to have schizophrenia
Part II
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
It's been a year since we first met
I don't know if we're boyfriends yet
Do you have any crimes that, that
We can use to pass the time I am
Running out of drugs to try and I
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In the mall in the nighttime
You came back alone with a flashlight
It was the start of nothing new (backwards)
And it was my favorite scene
I couldn’t tell you what it means
But it meant something to me
And pretty soon you'll find some nice young
Satanist with braces and one
Capital O, significant Other
And you can take him home to your mother and
Say ma, this is my brother
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
We said we hated humans
We wanted to be humans
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
Get more groceries, get eaten
By the one you love
When they put their lips around you
You can feel their smile from the inside
Part III
Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you
I woke up and I was trying to kill you
Your ears perked up
I perked up when your ears perked up
You were all looking around
And I hoped it was for me
I hoped you were using your sonar systems for me
The ancients saw it coming
You can see that they tried to warn them
In the tales that they told their children
But they fell out of their heads in the morning
They said sex can be frightening
But the children were not listening
And the children cut out everything
Except for the kissing and the singing
When they finally found their homes
At Walt Disney studios
And then everyone grew up
With their fundamental schemas fucked, but, but
But there are lots of fish left in the sea
There are lots of fish in business suits
That talk and walk on human feet
And visit doctors, have weak knees
Oh please let me join your cult
I'll paint my face in your colors
You had a real nice face
I had an early death
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
(How's your face? How's your body?)
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
(We're too scared to do shit!)
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Fight the power, fight the power
Fight for the right to get up and say fuck white power
Everybody come and get up, get on
And no matter what you fighting for I promise that it’ll live on
Like make America great again
Make it hate again
Make it white
Make everybody fight
Fuck that
Street’s disciple
My raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain
And everybody wonder why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane
Why the world insane
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

The world going mad over one drug
I'm filling up a bag at the gun club
In the shadow of a nation that it once was
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th
And stop to search me, controversy
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker

Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Young blood, it takes another look and feel
Slap that fear monger at that wheel
Olive branches in the arrow seal
Alternative facts mean to lie and steal
Gotta to go to ban the whole
Refugee population from the land they stole
In the name of the government
Rich white man while the rest be suffering
Run from the locked down borders
Ain’t like Flint ain’t got clean water
Dirty politics never come clean
Can ya'll believe this shit in 2017?
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my dick

George bush don't care about black people
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red
I know some people wish I’d act white instead
Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I’ma tell you what I need right now
I’ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don’t run from Trump, run against him
Hey mothafucka I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick

Ohh, hands up for the 5-0
Oh, ohh, hands up for the 5-0

I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck
I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a damn
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh
Dope in the trunk
Creepin out the cut
9 by the gut
Never get enough
I don’t give a fuck
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards
Mastered the hustle
Something in the duffle for you bastards
Grind over chatter
Cheese on my mind like a packer
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the day, like that shit’s okay
Never had a job, never had a education
Only know probation
Never had a job never had a education
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now send the blacks back to Africa
Build a wall for the Mexicans
Send the whites back to Europe
Give the land to the Native American
Take the skyscraper
Tear down the casino
Print your own paper
And bear down on the gringo

Fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all don't want money, y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die and embrace the thing
Trapped inside a burnin' church
Made it out alive, God know my worth
Raw face, Scarface
Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em, 20 on call
Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you then fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
Hey hey, ready, set, go crazy
Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines
A life hit a nigga with a lemon's limelight
But at night, we still committin' crimes, spittin' rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinnin' rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleedin' hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause 'coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city full of sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimmin' in the debt
Don't drown on ground, wait until you hear
9-1-1, freeze (zoom, zoom) dead

Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
–takes all (You're dead to me)

You know what zone I'm in (You're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (You're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
I move like a millipede
When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a riot in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham City Streets, I'll play the *bleep*
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colors in my aura tend to cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-res lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Wool over your eyes

Tangle my cords like a weaver

38 Baby

Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it
It's all bronze like a penny, only see fire when I spit it
I ain't shoot this bitch in a minute, a nigga play, he can get it

You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why

No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
Cold outside and you're just in a T-shirt
I have cold blood even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the Kilo
I don't, I know you know

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why

We like it in the end of time (We don't even know)
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
(We don't even know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know)
We like it in the end of time
Somehow, we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine
Somehow, we end up on the same side (Up on the same side)
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
(Think that we'd be alright)
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine

(Oh) Tell me how we're not alike

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I’m done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I’m done with it (Ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them

There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
Open up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half-Black, half-Thai
Don’t be prejudiced, cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named Maria, its your turn, I love them señoritas
I like to fuck 'em, then I say fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something

If I Die Young,The Band Perry,"If I Die Young Lyrics
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls61Embed"
Meditate,EARTHGANG,"Meditate Lyrics
(Lay, sleep, wake up, lay... down, sleep
Uh, wake up
Cry, eat, sleep, world...)
Everybody—uh
Everybody—uh

Okay, everybody wanna be a nigga, but nobody wanna be a nigga when it's time to be a nigga
If you thinkin' it, then say it, when you see a nigga; please be clear, I rhyme, I do not mind read
I ride the beat then have your girl ride the C-train to me to ride the D
And give me brain, and you can see the stains I place upon the sheet—oh, you gon' come for me?
Well, my nigga, you better have an army at least—more than a gun for me
I'm more than a man, not a god, but the boy is a man, we ignore all the noise from the outlandish
Standout with the cannon, outstandin' south bandit, don't panic, please, 'cause if I get nervous we get un-sturdy and we start to squeeze

Okay, niggadom
Nigga from nigga slum
Blue tongue, red tongue
Nigga flavors, go 'head, son, get you some
Nigga got a lot of gifts but
Package store was always open
Jail house don't ever close
And my world view was always shut
Trap spot was always bunkin'
Neighborhood was always crunk
See I was outside riskin' snakes eyes
With my life chances, stakes high
Only outlet was the moon walk
Michael Jackson dances, so shuck and jive, nigga, bust a nine
Shoot behind the line, my only advances
USA eat me like a cancer
UK eat me like a cancer
Gettin' money and they tag the crib
Ask King James, what's the fucking answer?
Still a nigga out in Calabasas
Still a nigga when I greet the masses
Oval office, presidential grasses
When I fuck my white girl and I meet her daddy
I know deep down inside, man, he hate that shit
Plotting for the perfect time to bury me
Nigga, please, show 'em the green like a caddy
Verena, Serena them daddy
But that shit don't change my appearance
Asians like, That's my nigga
Latins like, That's my nigga
White folks like, That's my nigga
'Til it's time to die, bye, bye, nigga
Now don't get offended, I was just giving you hard time
Come to your block, give you hard line
My, did I come at the wrong time?
But see I sent comets to the Earth
Me, I was humming at your birth
I put colors on the spectrum
I let you assign them worth
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace when I stare at you

You know I'm here for the nigga shit
Whole life been nigga rigged
Since my momma let a project nigga hit
Set it up so when I meet the reaper
Let my son reap the benefits
Nigga shit on social media
Get a nigga pinched, end up in the pen
Surrender your independence 'til the sentence finished
Even with no pot you got a cup to piss in
Burning bridges with my tunnel vision
Bitches leave niggas for cunnilingus
Fuck me like her nigga non-existent
No negativity, niggativity
Why you being silly fucking with me
Giggity giggity
When I'm in the city
They like, Doc you litty
Not as lit as I'm finna be
I just wake up and do shit differently
I can never say they doubted my ability
Along the way some niggas just wasn't feeling me
Niggas lost faith and quit on me (Kidding me!)
I just tuck 'em in the back of my memory
One monkey don't stop no show, my niggas got goals and responsibilities
So you know by any means, really mean any and everything to the team
Nothing off limits nigga, ain't gon' keep shit clean
Me and my niggas them niggas that they should've never let go free
Niggas got me talking through my teeth like I'm 50 Cent in '03
Ain't no Kunta Kinte, nigga Toby what they told me
What it's gon' be?
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
Looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you
I be looking for peace in America
Looking for peace when I stare at you, ooh
Looking for peace when I stare at you

Lift them titties up, thank you
Oh let go then, ayy
Finna pick these niggas up
Ayy, man get the fuck out my way boy this the Lyft driver

Yo, it's TimWestwoodTV, up at Capital Xtra

Bitches pay me like taxes
On the mattress, hittin' backflips
Ride me, carpet, Aladdin

Hoes on me, they wanna fuck too, though

Smoking on pack, you can smell the aroma

World on my shoulders, feel like a boulder
Run up on me, I told you that it's over
Chopper get to doin' motherfuckers like it's homework
Clip stickin' out like a motherfuckin' boner
This is my flow, it's not a motherfucking loaner
Only one of me, ain't no motherfucking cloners

Knock 'em out, lil' nigga, like Adrien Broner, uh
Look at the way that I ball on these hoes
In the back of the club, mm, mm

You got a problem with me? I'ma pull up with this chopper

It's a motherfuckin' outrage, nigga
These niggas make me mad thinking they can compete

But Juice WRLD 999, he's something to see
It's so hard when he rap that it's make-believe
He can't be freestylin' that shit for real, he be writing it
Nah, this off the dome, I do it to be excitin'

She hold my dick like a mic she was testin'
It's time to spazz on a track, that's what I do, uh-uh
Gun sing like Erykah Badu, uh-huh
Throw your body in the bottom of the bayou
So rich, motherfucker, I could buy you
Don't try me, but nigga, I will try you
I hope your ass ready to die, dude
Choppa on me, leave your mama traumatized, dude
Like a bunch of chicken, you will get fried, ooh

But then again I made it out and got a lot of money

My birthday December second
So please don't step in my motherfucking direction
'Cause if I feel threatened, I'm upping a Smith & Wesson
I put it to your face, best believe I'ma get it bustin'
I'm spazzing on a track, got an AK like a Russian
I hit you in your head like a motherfucking concussion

Something-ness out of nothing

Talking about how much money was in the cut
Interscope on the line, they was hittin' us up
At some point, we weren't even picking it up
Now, I'm Interscope money, but I got my own money
I can show some
If I went to the strip club, I could throw some
But I don't owe them bitches nothin', I don't pay for nothin'
Life is free when you live like me
Chopper hit your ass like, damn, he can't breathe
Stevie Wonder, when I rob, he can't see
Kill him on the news, it couldn't be me

You want smoke? Come over here, we can battle that
Uh, listen

It's only me and myself, I don't need no henchmen
I'm not a God, like I said, so I'm not forgiven

Yup, yup, that's right
I'm runnin' things, I'm runnin' things

Hold me down, hold me up
Hold me close 'cause my times is up
Show they true colors, don't know who to trust
Mind workin' like the water when it rush
Growin' from my father, bitter to his touch
Now I'm solely honor, livin' is a must
All this for my momma 'til I'm dust
God gon' deal the karma, lost my trust
Sayin' Every man know many men
Got me in a jam, I be in my feelings
On the other hand, I just need a moment
Offer my condolence, smokin' 'til the mornin'

Brodie on the corner with a piece on his hip
Give a warning 'fore you blow it in the sky
Tiptoein' over mortar and the brick
Bumpin' shoulders with the devil in disguise
Shoulder-level water on the rise
Twist, 40s in the morning in the winter
I heard you got your sauce at the Enterprise
Evidently, it was rented but it's mine
Evidently, it was written like Nas
I was in the kitchen with that nigga Mike
Gotta listen when I tell ya simmer down
Two years I've been missin', livin' life
You was wildin', every day was trash
Crackers pilin' in to rape the land
Early morning, wash my swollen hands
Hit the showers, cleanse my soul and crash
Tiptoein' over glass, brodie go too fast, told him slow up
Know I use too much of everything at hand
Except the difference is now I control it, I be
In the crib and in the moment, stuck sippin' out the flask
Feet up on the dash, I hit the spliff but don't promote it
Under overpass, no cap
Sand fallin' out the hourglass
Grand total, it's a whole lotta raps
Quicksand, scramblin' outta that
Go behind the back, switch hands
The fare's high, niggas know they outta wack
Sterilize your clique, paralyze maritime niggas when
Every time Wavy Don tappin' in
Savion Glover caught a couple Ls
Took 'em to the neck, motherfucker
Lotta blood to let, peace to make, fuck a check
Uh-uh, lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a check
Lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a check

I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red.

Let me find my way out of this bitch (Uh)
Find myself high in the distance (Uh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Ugh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner
Let me find my way out of this bitch (Ugh)
Find myself high in the distance (Ugh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Ugh)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner

Ayy, I'ma just bounce with that
In fact, I bought a whole damn house with that
Ayy, hand me where the ounces at
Tell me where the damn these ounces at
Ayy, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at
Ayy, tell me where the ounces at
Tell me where the ounces, ounces at
It's getting hot, you best just—
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
The effects can't touch this
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Stand up, stand down, bitch
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Wait, wait, wait

I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
I ain't ever been the one that's scared of you
Baby, you can come and get it
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
Baby, when the karma gets you, yeah
Maybe you can run away with us

In my bag in the vault, moving on, move along
Ain't my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt
Got back on the road and made it to the start
Disregarding the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playing games with you to play your part
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars
Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big-ass house and big-ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life, highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut, really know the place
Projecting on me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite
(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)

Praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, can't find that shit
Woo, praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, I can't—
Let me find my way out of this bitch
I'm Sammy Jo, and my favorite colors are, um, black and red. (Damn)
(Ugh) With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
(Ooh da-aa, da, da, da, da)
If I can't find the time to get my heart out (Ugh)
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? (Damn)
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? (Ugh)
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
Light it up, better dodge the cops
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I, I miss you lots, I, I miss you lots, I, I
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks, I, I

Innermission,Logic,"Innermission Lyrics
Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time
I think about specific moments that I could rewind
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide
And truly understand the deeper things
That I don't know about
Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now
Here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see life different like this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creeds all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free, uh

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind
Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing
When I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies
On a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times
I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem
To stomach all of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life
Where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why
This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

So what do you think about space?
Um, space is called the galaxy...
Do you know planets?
What are—can you name some planets off?
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth
Mars—and the planet Paradise
You've never been there before?
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—
But there was droid ships everywhere...
Well, thank you for your time, sir
I appreciate the interview...35Embed"
Colors and Shapes,Mac Miller,"Colors and Shapes Lyrics
Have I answered the question, 'Who am I'?
Mm-hmm
Well, I confront it all the time. We're teaching people how to use their head. The, uh... point is, that in order to use your h-head, you have to go out of your mind. You have to go out of all of the, uh, static symbolic ways in which you think.

If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks wit' your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, How do you do?''
I told him, I'm losin' my grip
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

Fall, ooh-ooh-ooh
Fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land, oh-oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothin' no more

If I jump, let me fall (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh
If I jump, let me fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Yeah, yeah
Love, uh-huh, hey
Love, mm, I told y'all
We would be the band to play it

My ghetto butterfly flew away from me
I wait patiently, by windows and doorsteps
Play make-believe as my tears pour, chest
Won't succeed to breathe, if not the air of you
Surely there has never been a shade so blue
A stink attitude, so not mad at you, uh
Not a magnitude to encompass the latitude
Of my love for you
No space or time compatible
What do I have to do? What do I have to do?
Ooh, my friends say I got it bad for you
I do, but there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Uh, but you
I want to make love to your existence, uh
Drenched in the colors of your energy
Then masturbate to the memories
I wanna lose myself inside yourself
Until you find me, confine me
To the freedom of your prison
Exist in the same space, same time
Combine until your thoughts slow grind with mine
Combine until your thoughts slow grind with mine
Combine until your thoughts slow grind with mine
My, I wanna drink the sweat of your intellect
Reflect, and watch your light passion mark my neck
Caress the sights of your presence with no question
Undress to the nakedness of love, pure love
I want to make love to my soulmate, my soulmate
Make love to my soulmate, uh, my soulmate
Make love to my soulmate, shit
I wonder, how does it feel to make love to your soulmate?
Kind of like writing poetry till climax
Till the point and place where our space and time match
And we cross divine paths, tell me, would you like that? Uh
Now would you like that? Tell me, would you like that
Would you like that? Tell me, would you like that?
Would you like that? Uh, I'ma ask you again now, tell me
Would you like that? Tell me, would you like that?
Now would you like that? Tell me, would you like that?
Would you like that? Tell me
I wanna love you more than madly, uh
Wrap these legs around your words
Until your speech is straddled deep, gladly
Swim the currents of your vibrations, uh
Be separate and one with the same meditation
Uh, same meditation
Uh, you know what?
This right here is poetry
Yeah, mm
And Julian, you gotta play that saxophone now
Hey

If love, if love had a sound
You know, this would be that sound
And we, well, we
We would be the band to play it46Embed"
Home,Cavetown,"Home Lyrics
Often, I am upset
That I cannot fall in love, but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

(Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm)
I'll cut my hair
(Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm)
To make you stare
(Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm)
I'll hide my chest
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My eyes went dark
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't know where
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open...
Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms

Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place16Embed"

Some stay dry and others feel the pain
Chocolate Rain
A baby born will die before the sin
Chocolate Rain
The school books say it can't be here again
Chocolate Rain
The prisons make you wonder where it went
Chocolate Rain
Build a tent and say the world is dry
Chocolate Rain
Zoom the camera out and see the lie
Chocolate Rain
Forecast to be falling yesterday
Chocolate Rain
Only in the past is what they say
Chocolate Rain
Raised your neighborhood insurance rates
Chocolate Rain
Makes us happy living in a gate
Chocolate Rain
Made me cross the street the other day
Chocolate Rain
Made you turn your head the other way
Chocolate Rain
History quickly crashing through your veins
Chocolate Rain
Using you to fall back down again
Chocolate Rain
History quickly crashing through your veins
Chocolate Rain
Using you to fall back down again

Chocolate Rain
Seldom mentioned on the radio
Chocolate Rain
It's the fear your leaders call control
Chocolate Rain
Worse than swearing, worse than calling names
Chocolate Rain
Say it publicly and you're insane
Chocolate Rain
No one wants to hear about it now
Chocolate Rain
Wish real hard, it goes away somehow
Chocolate Rain
Makes the best of friends begin to fight
Chocolate Rain
But did they know each other in the light?
Chocolate Rain
Every February washed away
Chocolate Rain
Stays behind as colors celebrate
Chocolate Rain
The same crime has a higher price to pay
Chocolate Rain
The judge and jury swear it's not the face
Chocolate Rain
History quickly crashing through your veins
Chocolate Rain
Using you to fall back down again
Chocolate Rain
History quickly crashing through your veins
Chocolate Rain
Using you to fall back down again

Chocolate Rain
Dirty secrets of economy
Chocolate Rain
Turns that body into GDP
Chocolate Rain
The Bell Curve blames the baby's DNA
Chocolate Rain
But test scores are how much the parents make
Chocolate Rain
Flipping cars in France the other night
Chocolate Rain
Cleans the sewers out beneath Mumbai
Chocolate Rain
'Cross the world and back its all the same
Chocolate Rain
Angels cry and shake their heads in shame
Chocolate Rain
Lifts the ark of paradise in sin
Chocolate Rain
Which part do you think you're living in?
Chocolate Rain
More than marching, more than passing law
Chocolate Rain
Remake how we got to where we are

History quickly crashing through your veins

Using you to fall back down again

Hello, salute
It's me, your duke
And I made something that's real
To show you how I feel

Hello, hello
It's me, Picasso
I will paint my words of love
With your name on every wall

When you leave, my colors fade to gray
Oh-wah-oh-ay, oh-wah-oh-wah-oh-wah-ay
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it every day
When you leave, my colors fade to gray
Hey, little lover, stay or all my colors fade away
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it every day
I sold my strings
My songs, and dreams
And I bought some paints
To match the colors of my love

Hello, hello
It-It's me again, Picasso
I will spray my words of love
With your name on every wall

When you leave, my colors fade to gray
Oh-wah-oh-ay, oh-wah-oh-wah-oh-wah-ay
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it every day
When you leave, my colors fade to gray
Hey, little lover, stay or all my colors fade away
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it every day

Ma-ya-hi, ma-ya-hoo
Ma-ya-hah, ma-ya-ha-ha
Ma-ya-hi, ma-ya-hoo
Ma-ya-hah, ma-ya-ha-ha
Ma-ya-hi, ma-ya-hoo
Ma-ya-hah, ma-ya-ha-ha
Ma-ya-hi, ma-ya-hoo
Ma-ya-hah, ma-ya-ha-ha
When you leave, my colors fade to gray
Oh-wah-oh-ay, oh-wah-oh-wah-oh-wah-ay
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it every day
When you leave, my colors fade to gray
Hey, little lover, stay or all my colors fade away
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it every day4Embed"
Vincent (Starry Starry Night),Don McLean,"Vincent (Starry Starry Night) Lyrics
Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn; a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will32Embed"
Luv(sic),Nujabes,"Luv(sic) Lyrics
I told you that story to tell you this one
Check this out, this goes out to my G

Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away your clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely

Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
(I mean that from my heart cause you make me feel good as a person)
Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, small tips on the avenue
Never wasted, all hits for a revenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for some time in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in my room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose my prerogative
There's so much love in me I got to give

'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
(I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person)
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
(I hope that you listen)
Oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like, I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realizes that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felt a sharper love in the limelight
From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back, that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music helps carry on
Like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

'Cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
'Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
'Cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
(I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person)
'Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
(I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person)
(You know what I mean? Makes me say ‘Well, that shit wasn’t THAT bad)45Embed"

Fake faces hiding everywhere
Made up, make-up, made up stares
To hide their stolen air
Don't look too close, don't you dare
Stupid seems to be in the air, in the air, everywhere
Blameless, I'll shatter through the glare
Make it, take it, they won't share

I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own
I can't blame them, I'll just maim them on my throne
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own
I can't blame them, I've just got to get to my throne

I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along
I am the latest colors, I stand above my throne
Waiting for an invite to never come along
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along

Trade places, staggered truth or dare
Only ask it if you care
Trace back to all the millionaires
Snake oil traders, no one shares
Soulless and stealing what they dare
Hold your deck to your chest
Faceless, nobody is your friend

I Get The Bag Freestyle,Young M.A,"I Get The Bag Freestyle Lyrics
All this is what we doin'
I gotta get cocky on this one
I gotta get a little bocky on this one, bruh, uh, uh

You get the bag and fumble it, I get the bag and flip it and tumble it
Car came with a slut in it, then I made the bitch cum in it
Double cuppin' it, no lean just the red punch with the rum in it
Silky on, fresh white tee with the Constructs on, thuggin' it
The block hot so I'm tuckin' it, Glizzy came with a drum in it
Treat my Nina like my old hoe, start actin' up and I'm dumpin' it
I don't really play the scenes like AD, I'm in the cut with it
Louis bag with the hunnids in it quarter million in it had to stuff it in it
Wake and bake in the oven with it, if it ain't skunkin I ain't fucking with it
White Cars with the black rims, but the inside peanut butter with it
Still gutter with it, still Red Colors with it, still blood for my brother with it
Benz truck put my mother in it, these checks keep on repeating
Bank account got a stutter in it, bitch nigga I'm eating
Treat the pussy like a plumber nigga, put my plunger in it she screaming
Kickin hoes out the hotel like a punter with it, they schemin'
Not stupid or a sucker nigga, hoes wanna come up I peep it
Young nigga from the concrete, now I'm seeing palm trees
Tryna get a double R on my car keys and on the car seats
Pocket full of Parsley, Glock in arm reach can't harm me
Mix the Jungle juice with the Jamba juice now I'm feeling saucy
Feeling like the old me, can't hold me, in the hood still moving dolie
If you ain't gang gang can't bro me, can't say you love me, gotta show me
She said it's hard to communicate, 'cause I only send emojis
I don't show no emotions - can't let you know me (uh)
Swag dripping Nose bleed (uh), gave away my rollies (uh)
They was getting old to me (uh), I know that was bold of me (uh)
Niggas ain't as cold as me (uh) shawty got a whole nigga
But she in the club poking me (uh), tryna get a hold of me (uh)
I should take her in the bathroom, but that would be the hoe in me (uh)
Ass looking like a baboon, man fuck it bring the hoe with me (uh)
Covered up with tattoos (uh) It compliment the Polo tees (uh)
If them haters got a attitude, hit em with shoulder lean (uh)
Milly Rockin through the bad vibes, time is money and if it ain't about the money
I don't have time (man), that slowed me down the last time (damn)
So I made that the last time, now it's stack rack time (uh)
Prolly been a wavy nigga, like back-back in my past time
All these funny looking niggas rapping, and they ain't really saying shit
And I won't say I hate the shit, I just won't play the shit
Still the Queen out the Brook, my crown still fit me right
Still in the streets like a city bike, still posted like a city light
Hadda get my pennies right, hadda change my diet up just to get me right
I remember plenty nights, living that Henny life never did me right
Now its more like plenty life, can't settle down, gotta busy life
I already know what that kitty like, I'm just tryna see what that Bentley like
Cut a lot of niggas off, I bet they talk about me
Fuck what you think and fuck what you thought, better off without me
I'm better off with less than more around me, fake nigga walk around me
Never had security, no cops never had the Law around me
Prolly me and three niggas, I just gotta keep killing
Getting wins outta loses, gotta keep Meek Millin'
We living, we billin, fat blunts, weed spilling
I invested in the weed business, 'cause I'm just tryna see millions
In the stu cooking up, cooking up, hadda put my feet in it
When life threw me lemons, I made lemon squeeze with it
No I don't need women, I don't know how I could keep women
I think I'm a good nigga, but I guess they see different
Can't get a girl pregnant, so I made my pockets pregnant
Money calling 9/11, got 7 figures but I can't stop at 7
Naw man gotta get it, getting guap till I die
Still get the guap in heaven, 'cause me and God we connected
And we got a great connection (uh), praying with my pistol on me (uh)
But that's just for my my protection (uh), Hennessy was my obsession (uh)
Just to get through my depression (uh), that was kinda my confessions (uh)
We need more spittas, less funny looking niggas
That's just my suggestion11Embed"
BTS - Crystal Snow (English Translation),Genius English Translations,"BTS - Crystal Snow (English Translation) Lyrics
Like snow piles up, I remember what you gave me
You gave me the courage to live

We met each other beyond all time
So now how do we do? Can we make it work?
This fragile love

The world moves faster than we thought
How we gonna change it?
We don’t know yet but for sure we will

(Eh) Love in our hearts, uh yeah
(Eh) slowly started to grow

I want to hold you one more time before you disappear
Ah, crystal flies high wherever it goes
Hey, there’s nothing else I want, I just want to feel a little more
Can I touch your heart？
I want to touch it but it keeps slipping through my fingers, someday, someday

Your little smile somehow hurts me
How can I be closer uh uh?
Why can’t I find an answer for this love?
How am I gonna find it? How?
Oh, let me know
Crystal snow only holds an ambiguous shape
I can't bear my story of unrequited love
Eh I’ll manage to change it on my own

(Eh) surely, I can promise you

I want to protect you one more time before tears run down your face
But crystal gets further from reach, the more I wish for it
Even after hundred years, I want to live with you
Can I be your one?
There is no single star in this snowy sky, oh, someday, someday

The two of us are already far apart
Even though we are meant to be together
Now we can't choose the paint that colors us
Even the black breath
Even your thick white fog
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel
Oh yeah, oh, crystal snow, crystal snow
Inside the white fog
Even though you pass through me and turn to water, you are still in my heart
(You are in my heart)
I watch you shining and reflecting on every single sparkling thing
I’ll wait for you no matter where
I want to see you, even if you're pretending, please hold this hand
The warmth of love started melting
This genuine warmth, please stay forever

I want to hold you one more time before you disappear
Crystal flies high to reach you
Hey, words aren't enough to express my feelings but I will tell you as it is
Can I touch your heart?
I want you to believe me, I’ll come get you
Someday, someday

It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(Let me see your smile, oh baby, eh)
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(Let me feel your love forever, hoo)
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
(Let me feel your love, our crystal snow yeah)
It’s always you, it’s always you, crystal snow
Oh yeah, crystal snow, oh, oh
Forever baby (baby), crystal snow9Embed"

Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
Shalalala la la la la, yeah..
Uh huh, yeah.. Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes, yeah

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso, I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me.
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I'll never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely

I want to be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah
But we got different reasons for that
Believe in me, 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I want to be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah!
Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, ah son
That's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me
Staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I want to be just about as happy as I can be

Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars18Embed"
Black Honey,Thrice,"Black Honey Lyrics
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
'Cause I, I want honey on my table
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
'Cause I, I want honey on my table

But I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest
Do you understand I deserve the best?
And I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

I try to stick this pin through a butterfly
'Cause I, I like all the pretty colors
It just fell apart, so I flung it in the fire
To burn with all the others
'Cause I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need

This time, I'll get it right
This time, I'll get it right
It's gonna be this time, I'll get it right
God, let it be this time I get it right

So I'm cutting that branch off the cherry tree
Singing, This will be my victory,
Then I see them coming after me
And they're following me across the sea
And now they're stinging my friends and my family
And I don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want, I'll do what I please
I'll do it again 'til I've got what I need
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees

Audition (The Fools Who Dream),Emma Stone,"Audition (The Fools Who Dream) Lyrics
My aunt used to live in Paris. I remember, she used to come home and tell us these stories about being abroad and I remember she told us that she jumped into the river once, barefoot
She smiled...

Leapt, without looking
And tumbled into the Seine
The water was freezing
She spent a month sneezing
But said she would do it again

Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make

She captured a feeling
Sky with no ceiling
The sunset inside a frame
She lived in her liquor
And died with a flicker
I'll always remember the flame
Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make

She told me:
A bit of madness is key
To give us new colors to see
Who knows where it will lead us?
And that's why they need us
So bring on the rebels
The ripples from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays

And here's to the fools who dream
Crazy as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make

I trace it all back to then
Her, and the snow, and the Seine
Smiling through it
She said she'd do it again14Embed"

And you took my armor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath

Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, Yes
But I'm scared

'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say I do
I do

See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say I do

Now let's dance with each other (Dance with each other)
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever

No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say I do
'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah

As a young girl
Louis Vuitton
With your mother
On a sandy lawn
As a sophomore
With reggaeton
And the linens
You're sittin' on

Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But it feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

Can you stay up
To see the dawn?
In the colors
Of Benetton
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you want to, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

Ooh, ooh

Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you wanna, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Don’t Let Me GO,G-Eazy,"Don’t Let Me GO Lyrics
If we shall dance we shall dance for the night
I wish for love but sweet love takes her time
Hand on my heart, allegiance to the night
Every star waits for the darkness to shine
Why do I cry when the tears never dry
Why do I drown when I look through your eyes
Love is the morning that succeeds the night
I was gone by the first sign of the light

When it's dark out
I search for love but don't find it
Just sex n drugs but don't mind it
Because nothing's real I'm reminded
And
I Do suppose
Ignorance is bliss truth be told
They say go smash these groupie hoes
N Spend money on some newer clothes
N put poison up through your nose
Well
Eventually everything fades
Even the brightest of Colors turn greys
Highs comes down But the pain still stays
Even the longest of nights turn days
Then
Wake up and it's over
Love to escape cuz I hate being sober
& you and I we never had closure
We just knew when it was over
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Troubled mind of an Artist
But the star comes alive in the darkness
Late nights Lower east side apartments
But the night is impossible to Harness
Soon as comes it Departs us
Couldn't stay & love you so I became Heartless
Lost track of our long term targets
Live n Die young leave a beautiful carcass
Thinkin when we just had met
Realizing now that it just wasn't meant
But how would we know If the time wasn't spent?
If only we could live where the sun doesn't set
Somewhere it's always light out and happy
You and I were like a Sid vicious and Nancy
I mean it was bound to be tragic its
No way this ever coulda lasted

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go24Embed"

(They did not know how long they had been there)
(They did not know how long they had been there)

Look…
Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict?
I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles
Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
(Down) Down from a huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one

Check his own breakneck pulse over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette,  the god’s last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous
Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
(Down) Down from a huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one

BERLIN,BROCKHAMPTON,"BERLIN Lyrics
She said, Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

Trade in that noose they put around us for a Cuban link
So my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
I remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
That pollution still ain't stunt my evolution
What you choosing?

No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea (Hoo!)
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics, need another dimension I can enjoy

She said, Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Reporting for the operation
I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my detail for decoration
So baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Told my baby I'd be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy 'cause in 2010, I had some old friends
That thought I'd be another—
Go fucking figure

If I pull up out the tool
Riding still up on the roof
Seems like only legends do
(Check this, hot lookin' babes!)
Bitch, and that's the fucking move
(I feel you, when she said—)
She said, Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look

Good riddance, goodbye
Out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time
This time, I get what's mine
Where the hell is your backbone?
Ducking me like whac-a-mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault
I just supplied the rope, ugh!
Most thoughts, I don't think twice
Make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama
But I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars
Do you think about me?
Ohh, ohh11Embed"
Rings,Aesop Rock,"Rings Lyrics
Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding
Where is the truth you promised?!30Embed"
When I Look at You,Miley Cyrus,"When I Look at You Lyrics
Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you
And you appear just like a dream to me33Embed"

Diamonds in my chain, niggas trying to steal my lane
Chronic in my brain bitch, I’m reppin' Taylor Gang
Smoke 'til I’m insane, drinking til' I’m throwing up
Only papers if you Taylor’d nigga throw it up

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I...
Open up your mouth, your grill gleaming (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

I got my mouth lookin' something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on, man)
My teeth are mind-blowing, giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grills

Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

These hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry

One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold

Forever ... (is a long time),Halsey,"Forever ... (is a long time) Lyrics
I spent a long time watering a plant made out of plastic
And I cursed the ground for growing green
I spent a long time substituting honest with sarcastic
And I cursed my tongue for being mean

And weightless, breathless restitute
Motionless and absolute
You cut me open, sucked the poison from an aging wound
Now fifty thousand war cadets
Would cower at this small brunette
To my surprise, not six feet high
Who'd reach and grab the moon if I
Should ask or just imply
That I wanted a bit more light
So I could look inside his eyes
And get the colors just right
Just right, just right, just


Build love, build God, build provinces
Build calluses, break promises
'Cause I could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it
What am I thinking? What does this mean?
How could somebody ever love me?
Talk to your man, tell him he's got bad news comin'30Embed"

These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in this track
Just smoked out, I ain't talking 'bout what you toke out
Get choked out fo'rilly, thinking that this shit a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't acting on the scene niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well schemed
I'm trying to have wealth for my well being by 18
Pockets healthy green, what the fuck is 12 beans?
I need the cake and cream, stakes is high like fiends off a dream
Jet streaming having cuisine with the best seasons
It's the vet season carry a vest you know the reason
I'm in Chiraq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
Your chicken strip tease us, thighs leg and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I don't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm sparrow
They ain't trying to see me in the battle, they lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga let alone the cattle
They just want to ride the saddle, it's so sad though

Hammers present, you gettin' wrapped up
Uhh, jump out the Mack truck, black tux
Go 'head and act up, drink the blood out of the brass cup
Your jewels are fake those are glass cut
No snakes keep the grass cut
Thick dominican women skin cinnamon with they ass up
Sick spinning, I stay shitting like a sick pigeon
Different colors glisten off the wrist prism
Blicker off the hip hit 'em, spun 'em
Chopped an onion, in the process peeped the diagnostics
See my shorty draped up in an ostrich
Smoking weed from the doctor
As I sit on a train to Paris draped in fabric like an Arabic
Mommy always knew her boy was talented
Come off tour give her 20 thou for nothing
Cause it's nothing to me I'm something to see
Sunk in the sea, Duncans on feet
Shits are shiny take a shower rather dump in the heat
Jump out the jeep looking fly like a bundle of geese, jeez
I'm on some shit
I'm talking 7 series triplets, bitches with military fitness
And my girl a shooter like Chamique Holdsclaw
With coke in the door, she used to play ball
For Christ the King, selling drugs got her the icy ring though
Me
The last black hippy to get a wiki
I'm in your city getting a hickey from your chick in her Vickies
Don't try act like I ain't popping homie
My style like Mandela meets Monster Kody
Cop backwoods by the box bro, OG only
Drop 460 for a zip, need 2 to be cozy
I hate to stunt but look me up
Evil Knievel ain't much when I do my stuff
Polo tee polo black cologne
Burberry by my nuts she won't leave me lone
The Levi's was on sale, but I ain't flexing hard
Flexing, never had a 24 Hour Fitness card
I told myself I wouldn't flip I made a little bit
I'm no magician but I hope this blue dolphin do the trick
Behind the mic with a thizz face
You take your Mrs. through my entrance thats a mistake
I got it bad like Usher Raymond
Middle finger to the plaintiff, screaming Top Dawg Entertainment
Look I don't know why you niggas hating
I take that back cause I know why you niggas hating
I just said it cause I likeded how it came in
I even used likeded, that ain't a word, I'm just saying
I got to be the greatest on this land, I spell high with
3 I's and I'll never never land
The rap Mike Jack, Peter Pan with 28 grams
Hendrix with no guitar, Albert on Adderall
Yeah, jug
Smoke 'til I'm Weezy don't worry what's in my cup
Speeding, and damn I’m leaning, on the Kawasaki
In the lobby, got me dro codinein’, out in Abu Dhabi
Chain beaming, hope it ain't anemic, cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, just me and four women, and we all playing hockey

Rainbow,Kesha,"Rainbow Lyrics
I used to live in the darkness
Dress in black, act so heartless
But now I see that colors are everything
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
Got back the stars in my eyes, too
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me

Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive
Dreaming in light, light, lights
This kitty cat lost her mind
Been lookin' for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright
Look to the skies

I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight

I'd forgot how to daydream
So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold
And I know that I'm still fucked up
But aren't we all, my love?
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are
So when the winds are howling strong
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart

You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight, night-night
Night, night, night

Ooh, ooh-ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Oh, put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Ooh, ah, ah

Previously, on Serial…
     Deirdre Enright
     I think the odds of you getting the charming sociopath-- you’re just not that lucky.
     Adnan Syed
     With Jay, it was more so kinda like -- in my mind I was like, “maybe the police are putting him up to this.”
     Jenn Pusateri
     I said, “what was your involvement? Were you involved?” He said no.
     Detective
     Before you stated you’d be willing to take us out and show us where the vehicle’s parked.
     Jay
     No problem.
     Detective
     Are you still willing to do that?
     Jay
     Yes sir.
Automated voice
This is a Global-Tel link prepaid call from Adnan Syed an inmate at a Maryland Correctional facility. This call will be recorded and monitored. If you wish to...
(brief interlude with music)
     Stella Armstrong
     Okay. My name is Miss Stella Armstrong. Baltimore, Maryland.
     Sarah Koenig
     And you were a juror on the Adnan Syed case, right?
     Stella Armstrong
     Yes I was.
Sarah Koenig
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it’s Serial. One story told week by week. I’m Sarah Koenig.
I wanted to know, from Stella Armstrong, why she voted to convict Adnan Syed. She immediately talked about Jay, that she believed him.
     Stella Armstrong
     Like I said, it’s been a while but I remember the one young man who was supposedly his friend, who had enabled him to move the body. That struck me that “why would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn’t done it?” You know what I mean? For what reason? What was he going to gain from that? He still had to go to jail.
     Sarah Koenig
     Yeah. Actually he didn't go to jail.
     Stella Armstrong
     Oh he didn’t? The friend didn’t?
     Sarah Koenig
     No. He walked.
     Stella Armstrong
     Oh! That’s strange. That’s strange.
Sarah Koenig
I asked Stella the same thing I ask anyone who has come into contact with Jay. What is Jay’s deal? And by that I don’t mean his plea deal, that he plead guilty to accessory after the fact in a first-degree murder, testified against Adnan, and got no prison time as a result. I’ll talk more about that in another episode. What I mean is, “what did you make of Jay?” Which, of course, is code for “what am I supposed to make of Jay?” How did he come across, sitting up there on the witness stand?
     Sarah Koenig
     What was his demeanor on the stand? What kind of kid did he seem like?
     Stella Armstrong
     He seemed like he was streetwise, can I-- I hope that’s the best way to put it. He seemed like he got around in the neighborhoods, or he was able to take care of himself. He reminded me of-- he would be that friend if you got in trouble you would call. You know what I mean? Say if I was back in high school and somebody was bothering me, he reminded me of somebody I would call to help me. Like if somebody was fighting me, or--
     Sarah Koenig
     So it was believable to you that he would be that guy for Adnan, like he would be the guy Adnan would turn to.
     Stella Armstrong
     Yeah, yeah. That was my impression. Because we all have somebody in our life like that, you know. You may know a cousin or a relative who if something goes wrong, you think you can call to help you.
     Sarah Koenig
     When you just said that, I just did a very quick scan of all of my contacts in my family and I feel like I can’t think of one. They’re all so useless! (laughs)
     Stella Armstrong
     We won't say “they’re all so useless.”
Sarah Koenig
The Jay that Stella saw at trial, he was wearing a tie, sometimes a jacket. He’s handsome, he’s tall and thin. You can see in the trial video how he has to bend over a little each time he speaks into the microphone in front of him. Since Jay’s credibility was the State’s case, Adnan’s attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, tried to rip it to shreds. That essentially was her defense. She uses the words “truth” and “lie” as often as possible in her cross-examination. There were many exchanges like this one. Gutierrez asks him, “and now your second interview on tape, that you were not telling the truth, were you not?” Jay says:
     Jay
     I was not telling them everything, no.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     What you were telling them were lies. Were they not?
     Jay
     Some.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     So the answer to my question is “yes, I was not telling the truth,” is it not?
     Prosecutor
     Objection.
     Judge
     Sustained.
Sarah Koenig
Gutierrez asks Jay about Best Buy. About how Jenn Pusateri told him there were security cameras in the parking lot and at the entrance. If Jay didn't kill Hae, why would Jay care whether there were cameras there, she asks. She puts it to Jay almost casually.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     You have us believe--
     Prosecutor
     Objection.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     --that you had nothing to do with the death of Hae Lee, right?
     Judge
     Sustained.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     One more question. Did you kill Hae Min Lee?
     Jay
     No ma’am.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     You weren’t present when she was killed.
     Jay
     No ma’am.
     Stella Armstrong
     The defense attorney tried to make him-- well basically she was trying to show that Jay killed her, and was blaming it on Adnan. That’s what I remember. Nothing led us to believe that he had a motive to kill Miss Lee. That really stayed with me because she was so adamant that he was a liar.
     Sarah Koenig
     Right, so you just didn’t buy that he was lying about it.
     Stella Armstrong
     I didn’t buy that it was a lie. I bought the fact that he was telling the truth about what happened at that moment.
Sarah Koenig
Jay took the stand on five different days during the second trial. This must have been a harrowing, nerve racking stretch in his life, but large swathes of the trial itself are really boring. Not just the procedural stuff, that’s always boring, but the cross-examination was boring. Even of the star witness. One defense attorney I talked to said that boringness can be a strategy. She said lawyers know that people can only pay close attention for so long. Forty-five minutes, an hour, before they start to flag. So it’s not theatrics that gets people to crack, it’s tedium; which would explain so much of what Gutierrez was doing if in fact that was what she was doing. She spends a lot of time on streets for instance, the trajectories of different roads, whether they travel northeast, or northwest, whether their names change as they cross from the city into the county, on buildings, how they’re situated.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     And that Best Buy is a boxy structure with the Best Buy logo at an angle, is it not?
     Jay
     Yes ma’am.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     And it’s plainly visible from Security Boulevard, is it not?
     Jay
     Yes ma’am.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     Right at the (cough covers speech) it changes its name, there’s a light there that if you were not on Security Boulevard, but on that street and you went straight you would go into the parking lot of Security Mall, correct?
     Jay
     Yes ma’am.
     Sarah Koenig
     Jay doesn’t crack though. He is alert, he is polite, he is he stays with her. He stays with her when she’s calm and soothing and boring, and he stays with her when she gets a little more shouty. He sticks to the “yes ma’am, no ma’am” answers which, if I had to guess, is probably seventy-five percent of what Jay says in cross. There is a part where Gutierrez tries to suggest that Jay was cheating on his girlfriend Stephanie with Jenn Pusateri.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     If you were stepping out on Stephanie, that would have had impacted on your relationship, would it have not?
     Jay
     With whom?
     Cristina Gutierrez
     With anyone.
     Jay
     With Stephanie?
     Cristina Gutierrez
     If you were stepping out on Stephanie, you understand what that term means don’t you?
     Jay
     Yes ma’am.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     Okay, if you had another girlfriend, anyone, any name, any where, that would have impacted with Stephanie would it have not?
     Jay
     I didn’t hear the last part.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     If you were stepping out with any girl of any name, from any location, that would have impacted your relationship with your girlfriend Stephanie would it have not?
     Jay
     Yes ma’am.
     Cristina Gutierrez
     And you were always aware of that, weren’t you?
     Jay
     Yes ma’am.
Sarah Koenig
Even when he gets irritated, Jay is civil. “Excuse me, your honor,” he says when Gutierrez gets loud, “could you ask her to stop yelling in my ear please?” Gutierrez died a few years after this trial, so I can’t ask her, but I have to think nothing she’s doing here is accidental. She was a successful, sought after defense attorney. She was aggressive. And obviously the courtroom is no place for pulling punches, but you gotta wonder whether moments like this hurt Adnan’s case rather than helped it, because, Jay seems like the underdog. It’s Baltimore. Half the jury is black, seven out of twelve actually. Jay probably comes off as a nice young man and this white lady is yelling at him. Sometimes unwittingly or not, Jay’s testimony is almost poetic. He says he told Jenn Pusateri to be honest with the detectives because “the lies that we were telling to try to protect each other were clouding the truth.” When he’s asked why he didn’t warn Hae that Adnan wanted to kill her, he says it was because he didn’t think Adnan was serious. “I took it as a grain of sand instead of concrete.” And when he’s asked why the image of Hae in the trunk of a car stuck with him, he says “I’ve never seen anyone dead before, and the first thing I thought was how fragile Stephanie was.”
People lie in court under oath all the time. Witnesses lie. Lawyers lie. Police lie. This should come as a shocker to no one. I’m not saying that’s what happened here, I’m just saying that I’m not assuming that everyone who participated in Adnan’s trial told the truth. But clearly the jury found Jay believable, or believable enough. After a six week trial, they convicted Adnan in just two hours. We talked to six jurors and none of them had any lingering doubts about the case. None of them wondered if the investigation was shoddy. None of them were much bothered by how Jay’s statements to police had shifted over time. So am I wrong to be hung up on that?
     Jim Trainum
     No.
     Sarah Koenig
     I should be concerned about the inconsistencies?
     Jim Trainum
     I’m concerned about them.
     Sarah Koenig
     You are?
     Jim Trainum
     Yes.
Sarah Koenig
As I’ve mentioned, the detectives involved in this case didn’t want to talk to me for this story, so I turned to this guy.
You are Jim Trainum. James? Do you like James or Jim?
     Jim Trainum
     Jim is fine.
     Sarah Koenig
     Jim Trainum, and we’ve-- we hired you, because unlike me, you’re a real detective. (laughs) I’m just playing one on the radio.
Jim Trainum used to be a homicide detective in Washington D.C. A jurisdiction not too different from Baltimore. He’s now become something of an expert on false confessions, and an advocate for better interrogation techniques. He goes around the country doing presentations about it. We gave Trainum everything we had on this case. Files, tapes, transcripts. Again, I want to be clear, we paid him for his time. It’s a huge amount of material to go through. I wanted Trainum to weigh in on two things. First, just overall, how would he rate the investigation into Hae Min Lee’s murder? Did the detectives do a good job, or did they screw it up? And second, how should I be thinking about Jay as a witness? What were the detectives seeing that maybe I wasn’t? Trainum said yes, he thought the inconsistencies were a problem too. But he also said “don’t forget the flipside.”
     Jim Trainum
     But I’m also looking at some of the consistencies too. He took them to where the car was. That’s a huge thing right there.
Sarah Koenig
Jay had a big piece of reliable information that the cops themselves did not know. Where Hae’s car was. Plus, Trainum said, Jay’s story completes a circle for the cops. They were suspicious of Adnan from the beginning, then from Adnan’s cell records, they get to Jenn, who leads them to Jay, who tells them it’s Adnan. So their suspicions have now been borne out, thanks to Jay, through Adnan’s own phone. A satisfying investigative circle. A murder case, on a silver platter, says Trainum.
     Jim Trainum
     He puts it on who they consider to be the logical suspect. I mean yeah, it’s pretty much a dream case.
Sarah Koenig
Part of what Trainum does is review investigations, and he says this one is better than most of what he sees. The detectives in this case were cautious and methodical. They weren’t rushing to grab suspects or to dismiss them either. The evidence collection was well documented. I didn’t expect to hear that even though its basically a one witness case, the cell records mostly don’t match Jay’s statements, there’s no physical evidence linking Adnan to the murder. Despite all that, to an experienced detective like Trainum, this looks like a pretty sound investigation.
     Jim Trainum
     I would said that this is better than average.
     Sarah Koenig
     Wow.
     Jim Trainum
     But what I’m saying is this: the mechanics, the documentation, the steps that they took, and all of that, they look good. Okay? I would have probably followed this same route. However, what we’re unsure of is what happened to change Jay’s story from A to B, and we do not know what happened in the interrogating-- those three hours and that will always result in a question as to what the final outcome should have been.
     Sarah Koenig
     Here’s what he’s talking about. In both of Jay’s taped statements, there’s a before. A period of time before the tape recorder is turned on. When the cops first bring Jay in on February 28th, they talked to him for about an hour before the tape went on. Then, on March 15th, the second interview. Jay signs his initials to an official explanation of rights form at 3:15 p.m. Then the tape starts.
     Detective
     Today’s date is the 15th of March. It’s approximately twenty minutes after six at night.
Sarah Koenig
6:20 p.m. So from 3:15 to 6:20, three hours have gone by since Jay signed that form. This is what’s called the pre-interview, and Trainum says, that’s where the mischief can happen. The contamination. Not necessarily intentionally, but it happens. The pre-interview was when the cops and the witness kind of iron out the statement so it can be taped as a coherent thing. That was standard procedure back then. Now, like a lot of jurisdictions, Baltimore homicide detectives videotape the entire interview from the moment the person steps in the interview room. On March 15th, we know the cops had shown Jay at least some photographs from the investigation, they refer to that on the tape. And Jay says at trial that he was confronted with the cell records during that interview as well, so you have to wonder, said Trainum, whether he was massaging his story to fit what the cops wanted to hear. The inconsistencies in Jay’s statements that the cops are catching him in, Trainum says, cops are used to that. Every confession has inconsistencies.
You just need to understand why they’re happening. Is he minimising his role? Is he protecting someone? In Jay’s case, yes and yes. But how do you make sense of the inconsistencies that don’t seem to have a purpose, like the one about going to the cliffs at Patapsco State Park that afternoon, how it drops out of the narrative at trial.
     Sarah Koenig
     --and from where I sit, I’m like, yeah, it doesn’t work because it doesn’t fit your timeline. He can’t get back to track in time. If you went out and smoked a joint.You know what I mean, anyway, I’m getting too deep in--
     Jim Trainum
     No, no, you’re not at all because I think that one of the biggest problems that we have with the way that we interview and interrogate here. The fact that we have a excellent witness-- we’ve got somebody who is giving us the whole case right here, he’s broke it wide open for us, we don’t want to ruin him, you know? So how much do you want to push, how much do you want to create “bad evidence?”
     Sarah Koenig
     But, there’s no such thing--
     Jim Trainum
     It’s an actual term, called “bad evidence.” Right. You don’t want to do something if it is going to go against your theory of the case.
     Sarah Koenig
     But, see-- I don’t get that. I mean that’s like what my father always used to always say, “all facts are friendly.” Shouldn’t that be more true for a cop than for anyone else? You can’t pick and choose.
     Jim Trainum
     Rather than trying to get to the truth, what you’re trying to do is build your case, and make it the strongest case possible.
     Sarah Koenig
     But, how can it be a strong case and how can he be a great witness if there’s stuff that’s not true, or unexplained.
     Jim Trainum
     --and the comeback is is that there is always going to be things that are unexplainable. Like I said, also remember, verification bias is kicking in here, as well. “I want to believe you, because you’re my witness and I think this is what happened” and all that. “So, the fact that you’re giving me something that’s inconsistent, that doesn’t fit my theory of the case.” What does verification bias cause you to do? Ignore it and push it to the side. That’s what they’re doing here, with these inconsistencies, they’re kind of pushing them aside.
Sarah Koenig
Trainum said it was curious to him, that the cops never searched Jay’s house for instance, that they never subjected him to a polygraph. Again he said, maybe that’s because he was on their team now, helping, so you didn’t want to push too hard. He said the cops “probably settled for what was good enough to be the truth.” He said he did have doubts about Adnan’s claim of innocence but that he definitely thought there was something “off” about this case. That we still don’t know what happened in this murder. We still don’t have the true story.
     Jim Trainum
     I don’t believe Jay’s version. I think that there is a lot more to it than that. I feel that he’s definitely minimizing his involvement. To either protect himself, he’s doing it for one of three reasons: to protect himself, to protect somebody else, or because Adnan did it and was right there with him.
     Sarah Koenig
     Right, right.
     Jim Trainum
     But, I cannot prove that he is giving it to me without contamination. The real problem is is that, how do you prove it one way or the other?
     Sarah Koenig
     Right.
Sarah Koenig
Trainum says the answers we want probably live in those unrecorded pre-interview hours. A black hole of crucial information. Since this stuff wasn’t all videotaped, there were holes that, as you’re saying, we are never going to know the answer. But for things that I could know the answer to if you’re me, what’s the biggest thing I need to figure out then?
     Jim Trainum
     Get Jay to talk.
     Sarah Koenig
     Okay, okay.
     Julie Snyder
     We passed the city limit.
Sarah Koenig
My producer, Julie Snyder and I, went to see Jay. We did not warn Jay we were coming, which is not the gentlest reporter move, I know. But I thought we’d have the best chance of success if we met him face to face, so we could make our case for why we wanted to talk to him and he could have a better sense of who we were and what we were about. But, because it’s also sort of a dick move to show up at someone’s door like that, Julie and I were nervous. I am so hyped up, listening back to the tape, I wanted to give myself a Xanax.
     Sarah Koenig
     I feel super excited to talk to him, like so excited to talk to him, I can’t tell you. Like, if this works, he knows, he knows everything we want to know, every questions we’ve had for the past eight months. Seven months, he knows it. Whether or not he tells us is a different thing but he’s a treasure chest of answers that we’ve been looking for this whole time and he has it, he’s it. But, whether or not he opens the door, or if he’s even home, we don’t even know if he’s home!
Sarah Koenig
We arrived, Jay was not home, so we came back again many hours later, knocked. Jay answered the door, tall and skinny and exhausted looking. A beer in his hand. It was Friday, probably the end of a long workday for him. He nevertheless invited us in, asked us to sit down. We didn’t record anything, we stayed about 20 minutes maybe. It was a tense meeting, and an emotional meeting, in fact. Afterwards, Julie and I felt like we’d walked into a stranger’s house, lobbed a grenade onto his living room carpet and then waved goodbye. We debriefed back in the car.
     Julie Snyder
     Here’s the first thing he said, I mean he said that there are a lot of people who say they don’t think Adnan did it. He very forcefully said, “well then who did?”

     That’s right, he said, “who did? I was there, I saw it, I know what I know.” He was very forceful, “I can’t even believe that he won’t even man up and admit it.” He just totally scoffed at the idea that, Adnan would be claiming his innocence. He was very calm, like how would you describe his demeanor?
     Julie Snyder
     Tired. Yeah, he seemed tired and wary. But actually very polite and actually sort of very sweet, and, tired and-- but he also said “I’m feeling so much animal rage right now even you bringing this up right now.” Which, he does a good job of, keeping it in, because he didn’t seem like he was about to-- I mean actually you could kind of see him about to hit something, but in a more frustrated, understandable way.
Sarah Koenig
Jay was, understandably, skeptical of us and of our motives. When we left, Jay said he’d think about an interview and get back to us. He left a strong impression. On Julie maybe, even more than on me.
     Julie Snyder
     Even just hearing him so forcefully deny, you know? And so forcefully say “I know he did it.” You know, you’re face to face, he’s right there, he’s a person. He’s saying it. He seems like he really means it. This is not pleasant for him to talk about. And so, it sounds believable.
     Sarah Koenig
     It does, I totally saw the appeal of him, as like a person and a friend and a witness.
Sarah Koenig
Jay and I corresponded sporadically by e-mail in the weeks following our meeting. He said he wasn’t afraid of the truth. Finally, in so many words, Jay declined an interview.
So, what is the deal with Jay? I talked to dozens of people. Mostly his friends and classmates. Kids who knew him from Woodlawn High School, they have a range of opinions about whether he was a good guy or not a good guy. But they all agreed, that he defied categorization. He was different.
     Male Voice #1
     He was like the Rodman of our social world.
     Male #2
     He was the one black kid that had a lip ring and listened to Rage Against the Machine and you know--
     Female Voice #1
     He would dye his hair different colors. Like, I think one time he had it red and another time he had it blonde. But the blonde lasted for a long time, I remember the blonde for sure.
     Male #3
     I remember he had a BMX belt buckle. And he had a belt buckle, like who the hell had a belt buckle?
     Female #2
     Basically, Dennis Rodman is the best way I can describe it.
     Male #4
     You know, if he was at my house and my mom came home and he left, she’d be like, “who’s that and why is he here?”
     Male #5
     It was like, whoa, he’s a weirdo. At the time, I didn’t know too many black guys that were into all of those piercings and shit and the big gothic jeans like that. Again, Woodlawn was a fairly black neighborhood, black community, black-- predominantly black high school, and at seventeen, anything different from you is weird.
Sarah Koenig
So Jay didn’t look like the other kids at school and he also didn’t act like the other kids at school. He loved animals, he once bought a giant rat eating frog, and he loved the outdoors. Fishing, hiking, swimming. He rode BMX bikes at an old skate park. He played lacrosse for Christ’s sake.
     Male #6
     I think Jay was actually pretty good at lacrosse. Tall wiry dude, he could run for days, there was no training needed for that kid, he could just run forever, which is a good thing as he wasn’t the type to put in a ton of training in.
Sarah Koenig
Right, because he wasn’t a jock. He was more of a stoner people said. He didn’t seem to care whether he fit in.
     Male #7
     And he always seemed very honest with who he was. He was kind of this, beautifully unconventional guy.
Sarah Koenig
Jay didn’t come from the same kind of household as a lot of the other kids he hung around with. He lived with his grandparents and his mom, but his friends say it seemed like he was more or less taking care of himself. He always had a job, his mother depended on him. Jay wasn’t in the magnet program at Woodlawn, he was “Gen Pop”, their term, not mine, like General Population at a prison. Anyway, he hung out with some of the magnet kids because his girlfriend Stephanie was in the program.
People told me contradictory things about Jay. Three women who knew him from Woodlawn, including one teacher, told me unflattering things about him. Nothing terrible, just that he was mean, or intimidating. Some kids thought of him as “shady”, that you wouldn’t want to push him. You got the sense that if you cross Jay, he’d come after you.
But then, I also heard descriptions of Jay that included the word “goofy” or “stoner”, or that the thuggish vibe was just a pose, something Jay put on to seem tough.
     Chris
     He’s, he’s an alpha, he’s definitely an alpha male.
Sarah Koenig
This is Chris who says he was one of Jay’s best friends around this time. He said Jay might say, slug you as you’re walking down the hallway at school, but he wasn’t mad or anything, he’s just messing around. Boys will be boys kind of stuff. Chris remembered this one story where it seemed to me all the different versions of Jay I’d heard, the goofy and the scary, were contained in it.
     Chris
     You know, we’d have weird arguments sometimes I remember outside of one of my cousins houses he tried to stab me because I hadn’t been stabbed before, so we got into a fight over-- actually I gave him a knife because I worked at a knife shop.
     Sarah Koenig
     Oh.
     Chris
     I gave him a knife and then he tried to stab me with it, so we were literally like fighting outside of my cousin’s house and he’s like “yo, I’m not gonna stab you deep but you never been stabbed before, you need to know what it’s like,” and I’m like “yo, I’m not gonna let you stab me.”
Sarah Koenig
I talked to three people who said they knew Jay well, or hung out with him around the time of the crime and I asked them if he ever told them about what happened. I went to Chris first because when Jay spoke to detectives that first night during his first taped interview, Jay mentioned Chris by name. The cops had asked Jay if he had told anyone else about Adnan committing this murder and Jay said he’d told Chris. Chris told me police never questioned him, not that he could remember anyway and he thought he’d remember something like that. There are no notes in their files about an interview with Chris. But Chris said it was true, Jay did tell him about what had happened, but his version, the building blocks are the same but the surrounding details are unfamiliar. Of course, giant caveat, it’s fifteen years later that I’m asking Chris to tell me, but for comparison purposes, here goes.
Chris says Jay told him he was at a pool hall out on Route 40 and Catonsville when he got a call from Adnan. The pool hall was either VIP or Bluejays, Chris says, they were across the street from each other at the time.
     Sarah Koenig
     He told you that Adnan came to get him when he was at a pool hall.
     Chris
     He was shooting pool, Adnan called him he was like “yo, I gotta talk to you,” and he was like “yo I’m busy.” “Yo, where are you” and he told him where he was. Adnan showed up and he’s like “oh I gotta talk to you” and he’s like-- this was a little tug of war for a while and Adnan eventually convinced him to come outside with him and his car or, I don’t know if he was driving his car or Hae Lee’s.
Sarah Koenig
In this version the trunk pop happens at the pool hall. Chris said Jay told Adnan he wanted nothing to do with it but Adnan forced him, told him he was in it now, he was an accessory and he knew Jay couldn’t go to the cops because of his own illegal activities so Jay was stuck. He helped bury the body. Chris figured Leakin Park was likely Jay’s idea rather than Adnan’s. Chris’s information about the crime itself doesn’t quite match the State’s version. He said, Jay told him that Adnan confronted Hae about flirting with another guy, a car salesman and when she called Adnan crazy, he snapped and strangled her. And Chris said he heard this happened in the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library. Remember that’s the one that’s right on campus where Asia said she saw Adnan that day.
Chris says Jay told him that Adnan threatened to kill Stephanie if Jay didn’t keep his mouth shut. This is not the first I’d heard about something like this. Jay told the cops that he worried that Adnan would hurt Stephanie too and he also testified at trial that Adnan has made it clear that he could get to Stephanie any time he wanted since they were such good friends. Stephanie herself tells the cops, this is in their notes of their conversation with her, that Jay told her to stay away from Adnan. Chris says Jay told him Adnan showed up at Jay’s house with Stephanie not long after the crime and made a gesture to indicate “I’ll hurt her if you’re not careful.”
     Chris
     So Stephanie goes inside past Jay and he steps out onto the porch with Adnan and he says “you’re not going to terrorize me,” and Adnan says “you keep your mouth shut or something’s going to happen.” If he had any weakness, it was Stephanie. Jay would do, he would move heaven and earth if it came to protecting Stephanie.
Sarah Koenig
I talked to Laura, a friend of Jay’s and Stephanie’s and Jen’s and of Adnan’s. Back then she was Laura Estrada Sandolo. She was close with Stephanie, they played sports together.
     Laura
     Her parents didn’t agree with their relationship because he was just-- they felt he wasn’t going to amount to anything. He wasn’t going to school. Stephanie, she’s beautiful. She was a star athlete. She got a scholarship at college. She’s perfect you know. She ran the fastest, she was always in shape no matter what. She could eat anything and she always saw the good in people no matter what, no matter if her parents were telling her he’s not a good influence on you. But because she loved Jay so much, she was going to support him regardless. She was his good thing in life. He was like, “out of all the craziness, Stephanie was his amazingness.”
Sarah Koenig
Stephanie didn’t want to talk to me and no one I spoke to who knows her wasn’t surprised by that. To a person they said she never talked to them about what happened either. They said it was like a wall came down and they couldn’t penetrate it. Laura told me it kind of did in their friendship because Laura really needed to talk about it and Stephanie wouldn’t, or couldn’t.
Laura hung out with Jay all that summer before the trial and she says they just didn’t discuss it. Hae’s murder was this enormous, sad, frightening elephant nobody wanted to go near. Jay’s friend Patrick told me he couldn’t get Jay to talk about it either.
     Patrick
     I think I just kept saying, “What happened? What in God’s name happened? In all this, like--”
Sarah Koenig
This Patrick by the way isn’t the one I’ve already mentioned in an earlier episode from the call log, different Patrick. This Patrick went to Woodlawn, he was a year ahead of Jay, so two years ahead of Adnan and Hae and Stephanie. Patrick lost touch with Jay when all this went down. He says he tried and tried to call but Jay never responded. Years later, maybe around 2005, Jay got back in touch one day and then they saw each other at a little party. Patrick asked him about it.
     Patrick
     I’d heard all of these like renditions and versions of stories from so many people, I figured, I have him in front of me now, I can get to the truth and he said “yeah, I was afraid he was gonna hurt Stephanie.” I said “like Adnan? He was gonna-- did he threaten her?” He just said he was afraid that he was going to hurt her so I think he took it as a threat but I remember when I pushed him for detail when I pushed him for more, it wasn’t-- I didn’t get it.
     Sarah Koenig
     He wasn’t going to go any further with it.
     Patrick
     He just wasn’t, you know and there was a lot of it-- kind of the chummy punching me in the shoulder kinda like “c’mon man, let’s just drink beer and hang out.”
Sarah Koenig
Patrick says the Stephanie explanation sounded pretty thin to him, but he couldn’t get anything else out of Jay and figured it wasn’t his place to force it. I asked all Jay’s friends I spoke to whether they thought Jay was telling the truth about what happened that night. I got some curious answers because his friends say Jay has a reputation for lying, but not for lying about something like that, something so big. Sort of the same way he had a reputation for being scary, but not scary-scary.
     Cathy
     The first thing that popped into my head was “Jay lies. That’s why he does that. Jay lies about everything.”
Sarah Koenig
That’s Cathy. Again, that’s not her real name or her real voice. She’s the person who said Adnan was acting weird at her apartment that night of the murder when Jay brought him over.
     Cathy
     When you were talking about it and saying, well you know, Jay has all these inconsistencies and stuff. The first thing that popped into my head was “that’s because Jay lies. Jay doesn’t tell the truth.”
     Sarah Koenig
     But like about what? What kinds of stuff are you thinking of?
     Cathy
     Everything. I think he was kind of like, about everything, nothing. I can definitely remember sometimes when Jay was telling a story and he would clearly know it was bullshit. I remember one time looking at Jenn and Jenn would roll her eyes like “here we go again. This is such bullshit.”
Sarah Koenig
Both Chris and Patrick told me that Jay would tell them stories, tall tales almost, that they figured had to be made up, but then sometimes these stories turned out to be true. Cathy said “sure, Jay might lie about what he had for breakfast or even whether he went to Patapsco State Park on the afternoon of January 13 1999,” but she didn’t think that Jay was lying about the crime itself because she’s convinced Adnan is guilty based on Adnan’s behavior that night and what he was saying when he got that phone call at her house.
Then there’s Jenn Pusateri. Of all the people Jay told about this crime, I wondered most about Jenn. If she ever thought Jay was lying about that night. I spoke to her briefly at her work, she works at a discount store. She wasn’t rude, but she was totally uninterested in talking to me. She had nothing to hide, she said, she just did not want to talk about that time in her life, period. She did answer my one big question, though, and her answer was yes. She believed Jay then, and that hasn’t changed in the intervening years. I said, yeah, but he did lie to you somewhat back then. Remember, he tells Jenn that night that he doesn’t know where Adnan put Hae’s body. That they don’t know enough to go to the police. Jenn told me she could understand that kind of lie. That anyone in his position forced into something he wanted no part of, anyone might have told the same kind of lie. It didn’t shake her trust in his overall story. Then she added, there was one thing she never believed. She said she never believed the murder happened at Best Buy, because she thought there would have been security footage, and that never came out. I told her it seems like maybe there really weren’t security cameras at Best Buy back then, and she kind of shrugged and said: “Oh well, see, I don’t know.”
Plenty of people I talked to said when they heard Jay was wrapped up in a murder, it didn’t surprise them. Adnan, they said no way, shocking. But Jay? Not so shocking. People also said they couldn’t square Jay feeling threatened by Adnan. The dynamic of that just seemed wrong to them. But then there’s Patrick, and Laura, and Cathy, people who’d spent a lot of time with Jay, people who were shocked by Jay’s involvement. They couldn’t see why Adnan would even turn to Jay for something like that, it made no sense. They said that wasn’t the laid-back Jay they knew, the same thing almost every single one of Adnan’s friends says about him. So they end up in this inbetween place where they can’t quite wrap their minds around the story of that night. Here’s Patrick again. To him, Jay was this intelligent, inquisitive, sweet, goofy guy, beautifully unconventional.
     Patrick
     I think part of me hopes-- I know this is so terrible to say. I hope in some way his hand was forced, that he was, that he had no choice, or that things were outside of his control, and maybe he was looking out for the safety and wellbeing of others, and he wasn’t such a willing participant as he was, and I, certainly hope that he wasn’t.
Sarah Koenig
That grappling you can hear in his voice, that’s so common among this group of friends. People like Laura, who can’t imagine Adnan killing anyone, but also can’t imagine Jay doing what he said he did, or why he would lie about something so huge. If you’re Laura and there’s no scenario here you can rationalize, you’re left with fog. This piece of tape I’m about to play you, it’s my favourite piece of tape from all my reporting so far, because I relate to it so precisely. It could be me talking to Laura, instead of the other way around.
     Laura
     Well then who the fuck did it, like, why would-- it doesn’t make sense. Why would-- (stuttering) Hae was-- I can’t-- I’m probably just as confused as you are.
Sarah Koenig
At Jay’s sentencing for his accessory after the fact conviction, he’s wearing a white shirt, his long arms hanging at his side. He’s towering over his lawyer who’s petite. She tells the judge all the stuff a defense attorney tends to cover at a sentencing, Jay’s tough upbringing, that he didn’t have adults helping him set a moral compass, that he’s hard working and loves animals and is good with kids, that he’s headed to college and wants to better himself. She says he underwent “rigorous and demeaning cross examination on the part of Christina Gutierrez” and she says he’s remorseful. She says, just now he was weeping in the hallway about Hae Lee.
Prosecutor Kevin Urick tells the judge he’s thoroughly pleased with Jay’s participation in the case and impressed.
     Kevin Urick
     --as I said very satisfactory and I believe honestly testified and also I would say something you don’t usually see I think he actually showed remorse during-- I saw real remorse on his part so I’d be happy to make that recommendation on his--
Sarah Koenig
The judge is impressed too and Jay does seem genuinely torn up.
     Judge
     Is there anything you wanna say before I impose sentence?
     Jay
     Just that, whatever you do decide, I’d like you to know that I have a real hard time even sitting here, because I feel like people look at me and they think I’m a horrible person and that, I’m really sorry for my part in what happened.
Sarah Koenig
The judge sentences Jay to two years probation, no jail time. His lawyer mouths the words ‘thank you’ to the judge. Jay leaves the courtroom with the only person who came with him that day, Stephanie.
Adnan didn’t testify at his trial, which isn’t unusual. Jurors aren’t supposed to take that into consideration. The judge tells them so. That they are not allowed to hold that against a defendant when they’re deliberating.
     Sarah Koenig
     Did it bother you guys as a jury that Adnan himself didn’t testify, didn’t take the stand?
     Lisa Flynn
     Yes, it did.
Sarah Koenig
That’s Lisa Flynn, one of the jurors.
     Lisa Flynn
     That was huge. We just-- yeah, that was huge. We all kinda like gasped like, we were all just blown away by that. You know, why not, if you’re a defendant, why would you not get up there and defend yourself, and try to prove that the State is wrong, that you weren’t there, that you’re not guilty? We were trying to be so open minded, it was just like, get up there and say something, try to persuade, even though it’s not your job to persuade us, but, I don’t know.
Sarah Koenig
So what was Adnan thinking while all this was going down? What do I know about Adnan that the jury didn’t.

For what you did to me, and what I'll do to you
You get what everyone else gets, you get a lifetime, go!
Let's go!

Do you remember that day, when we met?
You told me this gets harder, well, it did
Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies

The damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

We never got that far, this helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
Just you and I, your starless eyes remain

Hip-hip-hooray for me, you talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep? Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary, we could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

This hole you put me in wasn't deep enough
And I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places
To hide from me

When you go, just know that I will remember you!
If living was the hardest part, we'll then, one day, be together!
And in the end, we'll fall apart just like the leaves changing colors!
And then I will be with you, I will be there one last time now!
When you go, just know that I will remember you!
I've lost my fear of falling, I will be with you, I will remember you!22Embed"

Licking your fingers like you're done and
You've decided there is so much more than me (oh)

Hold my heart it's beating for you anyway

I was growing younger day by day
There was love and it was all the rage
And I held you with a wandering eye
Now I know the girl I shoulda known
Now I feel the love I should've shown
And I pull you in but you push me out

And I know you don't love me so
But please say it once before I go

I know that you can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie

Colors in the dress you used to wear
The way that you'd put up your golden hair
But I'll turn the lights down and leave
All the ways that I could say it now
You're the girl to push away my doubt
But it's too late and we’re too young to know
And I know you don't love me so
But please say it once before I go

I know that you can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time

Live on as if you still love me

BURN IT DOWN,Linkin Park,"BURN IT DOWN Lyrics
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground53Embed"

Huh, yeah, it's Gucci!
Tiller! Brr, brr-brr!

Pull up in a Lam', it'll drive you crazy
Had to cut her off cause the bitch too lazy
She wanna ride the wave, but my waves too wavy
And your car too slow, you need to drive Miss Daisy
Jumped out the feds like, Fuck you, pay me
Got her foamin' mouth like the bitch got rabies
Got me runnin' out the spot like the spot got raided
'Cause I'm so much different then the nigga you dated
Smilin' in the camera like, Bitch, I made it
Big Guwop got the whole club faded
Got a bitch so bad that my ex bitch hate it
Tell me how you feel when you see me skatin'
Nah, you don't call me baby
We ain't finna go to the mall,Ms. Lady
When you leave me feelin' standin' tall, Ms. Lady
Like can you take it, take it, take it all, Ms. Lady?
Never get a love like this
Never ever, ever meet a thug like this
Never met a plug like this
Never seen a nigga in the club like this
Never hug like this
Never pour Ace of Spades in the tub like this
Never got drunk like this
Or beat from the back on the rug like this

Talk about how crazy you drove me
Talk about them favors you owe me

My old bitch said she need closure
I just think she wanna get closer
I just think she want some exposure
Tell people how crazy I drove her
Tell people all the dreams I sold her
I'm sorry, you cannot lean on my shoulder
I already got too many burdens
Most of them 'bout to give to my attorney
I got too many niggas in my face now
This ain't the time 'nor place now
This for my niggas that stay down
Fuck all you niggas that wanna hate now

Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,Geto Boys,"Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta Lyrics
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
Now, everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five, ayo, 24/7
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you, wannabe, gonnabe
Cocksucking, pussy-eating pranksters
Is when the fire dies down, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now, I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz
Hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters:
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out
And end up hitting the ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players
And everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All you hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
'Cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta
(And now, a word from the President.)

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down
Like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supporting me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
’Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta26Embed"
THUG LIFE,BROCKHAMPTON,"THUG LIFE Lyrics
I gotta get that bag
It's a thug life, it's a thug life
I gotta get that bag (Run, sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
It's a thug life (La-da-da-da)
It's a thug life (It's a, oh-uh-oh)
Ooh-ah (Sha-na-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
La-da-da-da (It's a— ooh-uh-oh)

Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy you know you don't look fly
Dem gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah

It's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know I possessed
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept
I understand what I neglect in times when I obsess
I'm learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest
The biggest threat I'm up against is who I face in my reflection
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
Can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace
When I know that it'll kill me if I give into my brain
I see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes
They put my head in the water and it's so beautiful under
The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can't describe
To make the darkness divine
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
(La-da-da-da) It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
(La-da-da-da) It's a, oh-uh-oh

We Are,ONE OK ROCK,"We Are Lyrics
We are, we are
We are, we are

They think that we're no one
We're nothing, not sorry
They push us
It’s too late, it’s too late
Not going back
They think we are made up
Of all of our failures
They think we are foolish
And that’s how the story goes

They stand for nothing
They’re lifeless and cold
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold

When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
Now covered in madness
But they just can’t hurt us
They tell us we're nothing
Keep walking and let it go

They are the weakest
And don’t even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold

When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark

Never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid
So never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark2Embed"
True Colors,Cyndi Lauper,"True Colors Lyrics
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

Can't remember when I last saw you laugh

If this world makes you crazy
You've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors
True colors are shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show

Roger That,Young Money,"Roger That Lyrics
I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks, trick-or-treating the clutch
C'mon nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow, flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?
As-Salaam Alaykum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I've done penny nickel dimed, I done coined the phrase, ha!
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Lear
Indian-style, courtside with a cavalier
V.I.P. rosé; you can have a beer
'Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Now R-Roger that, R-R-Roger that
R-Roger that, R-R-Roger that
R-Roger that, R-R-roger that
R-R-R-R, ROGER

Young black Ricos, kill for the C-notes
But me though, I Jackson bitch uhh, Tito
She wanna play games but, this is not bingo
Monopoly, I'm past go, go on ahead and deep-throat
Four chick foursomes, skin color's mocha
Sally and Sonia, put the pussies on my totem
Pole vault stroke 'em uhh, strike ya like bowling
Now open like you yawning, it's 6 in the morning
Sleeping on me, probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fucking August, I'm awesome
I'm awesome: repeat it to ya grandma, and uncles
Or mothers, Tyga's no dad but I'm the motherfucker
Motherfuckers, this the last supper
Look, no hands, I'ma bread cuffer
I don't dare love her, I'ma daredevil
I don't fear nothing motherfucker, Young Money!
Now Roger that, Roger that
Ro-Roger that, Ro-Ro-Ro-Roger that
Fuck around and never get Roger back
Ha ha ha

I'm goin' in!
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette
The blunt still wet, so pass it like Brett
We sip side of mug, we call it upset
Smoke more than four quarters, we call it sudden death
I'm a beast. You a pet
AK long neck. Keith Sweat, haha!
Weezy motherfucker, Capo in this bitch with me
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me
I'm mountain high Colorado in this bitch with me
Flow crazy 7:30, you just 6:50
Twenty bullets from the chopper take the roof off
Laughing to the bank, I'm a goofball
Hahaha! It's YM
And we at your neck, like a violin
It's our world, we make it spin
And y'all the prey- amen!

Now Roger that, Roger that
Where Roger at? I heard Rog' a rat
Fuc-fuck around and never get Roger back!!

Stand Tall,Childish Gambino,"Stand Tall Lyrics
When the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can

How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do

Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall

Oh!
Give me a moment, oh, oh, oh
When they're gone, keep to yourself
Oh, oh, woo, oh, ooh, yeah!
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
(Thanks for doing that, thank you)
Oh! Oh!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall)
Ooh! Oh!22Embed"
Don’t Play This Song,Kid Cudi,"Don’t Play This Song Lyrics
Hey, let's have some fun this time

Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right
Please, please don't play this song
Yeah, haha

Pain, hurt, sadness, and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song (Please don't play this song)
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (Right)
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right (Hey, whoa)
Please, please don't play this song (Yeah, hey)

Black Robin Hood, riding high just like we should
You know the saying, ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Yeah, demented, my brain was forced to transform
Wise up, I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it, Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders; HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar, bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself, hovered
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (—ight)
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right (Me)
R-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (They thinking 'bout me)
Please, please don't play this song, aha
